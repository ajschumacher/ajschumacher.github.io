<h1>“how the world could be made a good and happy place”</h1>
<p class="date">Sunday October 17, 2021</p>
<p>The opening of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a> goes like this
(italics in original, bold added):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the
Western Spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun.
Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-eight million miles is
an utterly insignificant little blue-green planet whose apedescended
life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital
watches are a pretty neat idea.</em></p>
<p><em>This planet has—or rather had—a problem, which was this: most of
the people living on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time.
Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these
were largely concerned with the movements of small green pieces of
paper, which is odd because on the whole it wasn’t the small green
pieces of paper that were unhappy.</em></p>
<p><em>And so the problem remained; lots of the people were mean, and most
of them were miserable, even the ones with digital watches.</em></p>
<p><em>Many were increasingly of the opinion that they’d all made a big
mistake in coming down from the trees in the first place. And some
said that even the trees had been a bad move, and that no one should
ever have left the oceans.</em></p>
<p><em>And then, one Thursday, nearly two thousand years after one man had
been nailed to a tree for saying how great it would be to be nice to
people for a change, <strong>a girl sitting on her own in a small café in
Rickmansworth suddenly realized what it was that had been going
wrong all this time, and she finally knew how the world could be
made a good and happy place. This time it was right, it would work,
and no one would have to get nailed to anything.</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Sadly, however, before she could get to a phone to tell anyone
about it, a terrible, stupid catastrophe occurred, and the idea was
lost for ever.</em></p>
<p><em>This is not her story.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think the joke is that there is no such idea (so let's have nihilist
sci-fi fun) but I still don't like it. I bet Douglas Adams would have
written her story if he could have.</p>    </article>
