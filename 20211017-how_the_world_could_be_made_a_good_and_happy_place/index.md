# “how the world could be made a good and happy place”

The opening of [The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy][] goes like this
(italics in original, bold added):

> _Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the
> Western Spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun.
> Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-eight million miles is
> an utterly insignificant little blue-green planet whose apedescended
> life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital
> watches are a pretty neat idea._

> _This planet has—or rather had—a problem, which was this: most of

> Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these

> _And so the problem remained; lots of the people were mean, and most

> _Many were increasingly of the opinion that they’d all made a big

> _This is not her story._

I think the joke is that there is no such idea (so let's have nihilist
sci-fi fun) but I still don't like it. I bet Douglas Adams would have
written her story if he could have.
