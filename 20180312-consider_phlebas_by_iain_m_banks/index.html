<h1>Consider Phlebas by Iain M. Banks</h1>
<p class="date">Monday March 12, 2018</p>
<p>Amazon <a href="http://variety.com/2018/tv/news/consider-phlebas-iain-m-banks-amazon-novel-dennis-kelly-1202706327/">is</a> making a sci-fi TV show based on the 1987 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consider_Phlebas">Consider Phlebas</a>. Focusing on certain cultural aspects would be interesting, or it could be just another space opera.</p>
<p>There's a war between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Culture">The Culture</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_civilisations_in_the_Culture_series#Idirans">Idirans</a>. They could stand in for modern American society: The Culture is liberal, the Idirans are conservative. In one paragraph Banks uses the word "contempt" eight times, which reminded me of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Politics-Resentment-Consciousness-Wisconsin-American/dp/022634911X">The Politics of Resentment</a>. The comparison isn't perfect, but it could be explored.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the bulk of the 514 pages is given to the details of who punched who, and how. Some ideas infiltrate a chapter about a cannibalistic cult, or poker for human lives. The chapters, especially early ones, are very episodic, and I could imagine Amazon following the material closely if they wanted to.</p>
<p>The Culture has sentient artificial Minds that participate in and even guide their society. This is the kind of thing I was hoping to read about, but it's largely swamped by swashbuckling. It would be neat to see Amazon produce a slightly more conceptual adventure based on the source material.</p>
<p>Why the weird title? It's from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._S._Eliot">T. S. Eliot</a>'s poem, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Waste_Land">The Waste Land</a>. The relevant section:</p>

IV. Death by Water

Phlebas the Phoenician, a fortnight dead,
Forgot the cry of gulls, and the deep sea swell
And the profit and loss.
                                   A current under sea
Picked his bones in whispers. As he rose and fell
He passed the stages of his age and youth
Entering the whirlpool.
                                  Gentile or Jew
O you who turn the wheel and look to windward,
Consider Phlebas, who was once handsome and tall as you.

<p><a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/47311/the-waste-land">The Waste Land</a> overflows with allusion; just to read the words as written requires six languages or so. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consider_Phlebas">Consider Phlebas</a>, in comparison, is much less dense.</p>
