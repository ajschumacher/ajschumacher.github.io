# Doordash's Values

 * We are leaders.
     * Be an owner
     * Dream big start small
     * Choose optimism and have a plan
 * We are doers.
     * Bias for action
     * Operate at the lowest level of detail
     * And not either/or
 * We are learners.
     * Truth seek
     * 1% better every day
     * Customer-obsessed, not competitor focused
 * We are one team.
     * Make room at the table
     * Think outside the room
     * One team, one fight


These are taken directly from [DoorDash][]. I don't know much about
the history of their development. It is interesting that they arrange
their 12 values into sections this way; I haven't seen that elsewhere
yet.
