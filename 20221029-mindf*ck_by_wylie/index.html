<h1>Mindf*ck, by Wylie</h1>
<p class="date">Saturday October 29, 2022</p>
<p>Cambridge Analytica was a US brand for the UK's SCL (Strategic
Communication Laboratories) Group. They <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal" title="Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal">got</a> Americans to fill out
personality surveys and install an app that sent them Facebook
information on likes, friends, etc. They used all this to advance the
agendas of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Bannon">Steve Bannon</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mercer" title="Robert Mercer">Bob Mercer</a>, for example.</p>
<p>Facebook's crime in this seems to have been basically negligence. They
let a lot of information be accessible at the time, and people did
unsavory things with it. It's a little weird to call it a data breach,
since the system was working as intended.</p>
<p>I wonder how (or whether) Cambridge Analytica evaluated their
effectiveness... Trump became president, but was it <em>because of</em>
Cambridge Analytica? Or were they just pushing in a direction that
already had momentum? It is both horrifying and attractive to think
that manipulative actors are responsible for massive unpleasant
outcomes. But what share of the blame can be assigned?</p>

<p>"This [idea to simulate behavior with computers] brought to mind
experiments from the 1990s in a niche field of sociology called
"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_society" title="Artificial society">artificial societies</a>," which involved attempts by crude
multi-agent systems to "grow" societies in silico. I could remember
as a teenager reading Isaac Asimov's <a href="https://planspace.org/20200714-foundation_trilogy/" title="Asimov's Foundation trilogy"><em>Foundation</em></a> series, where
scientists used large data sets about societies to create the field
of "psychohistory," which allowed them to not only predict the
future but also control it." (page 81)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"In 2012, Facebook <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US8825764B2/en" title="Determining user personality characteristics from social networking system communications and characteristics">filed</a> for a U.S. patent for "<em>Determining
user personality characteristics from social networking system
communications and characteristics</em>." Facebook's patent application
explained that its interest in psychological profiling was because
"inferred personality characteristics are stored in connection with
the user's profile, and may be used for targeting, ranking,
selecting versions of products, and various other purposes."" (page
96)</p>

<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"In fact, a 2015 <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1418680112" title="Computer-based personality judgments are more accurate than those made by humans">study</a> by Youyou, Kosinski, and Stillwell showed
that, using Facebook likes, a computer model reigned supreme in
predicting human behavior." (page 103)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"It contained complete profiles of tens of thousands of users—name,
gender, age, location, status updates, likes, friends—<em>everything</em>.
Kogan said his Facebook app could even pull private messages."
(pages 104-105)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The private messages bit is quite the unsupported claim.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>""Think about it," I said to Bannon. "The message at a Tea Party
rally is the same as at a Gay Pride parade: <em>Don't tread on me! Let
me be who I am!</em>"" (page 117)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"A select minority of people exhibit traits of narcissism (extreme
self-centeredness), Machiavellianism (ruthless self-interest), and
psychopathy (emotional detachment). In contrast to the Big Five
traits found in everyone to some degree as part of normal
psychology—openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness,
and neuroticism—these "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_triad" title="Dark triad">dark triad</a>" traits are maladaptive,
meaning that those who exhibit them are generally more prone to
antisocial behavior, including criminal acts. From the data CA
collected, the team was able to identify people who exhibited
neuroticism and dark-triad traits, and those who were more prone to
impulsive anger or conspiratorial thinking than average citizens.
Cambridge Analytica would target them, introducing narratives via
Facebook groups, ads, or articles that the firm knew from internal
testing were likely to inflame the very narrow segments of people
with these traits. CA wanted to provoke people, to get them to
engage." (pages 119-120)</p>
<p>"As it happens, the most engaging content on social media is often
horrible or enraging." (page 120)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits">Big Five personality traits</a> stuff reminded me of what
I've heard about <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Righteous-Mind-Divided-Politics-Religion/dp/0307455777/">The Righteous Mind</a>: describing Republicans as low
on openness and high on conscientiousness, while Democrats are the
reverse.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Cambridge Analytica's research panels also identified that there
were relationships between target attitudes and a psychological
effect called the <em>just-world hypothesis</em> (JWH). This is a cognitive
bias where some people rely on a presumption of a fair world: The
world is a fair place where bad things "happen for a reason" or will
be offset by some sort of "moral balancing" in the universe. We
found that people who displayed the JWH bias were, for example, more
prone to victim-blaming in hypothetical scenarios of sexual assault.
If the world is fair, then random bad things should not happen to
innocent people, and therefore there must have been a fault in the
victim's behavior. Finding ways to blame victims is psychologically
prophylactic for some people because it helps them cope with anxiety
induced by uncontrollable environmental threats while maintaining a
comforting view that the world will still be fair <em>to them</em>.</p>
<p>"Cambridge Analytica found that JWH was related to many attitudes,
but that it had a special relationship with racial bias." (page 129)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This idea—the just-world hypothesis considered harmful—is very
interesting.</p>

wild-haired black criminals running amok." (page 131)</p>

American clients that was entirely staffed by SCL personnel." (page

<p>"Cambridge Analytica identified that many people in non-urban
regions or in lower socioeconomic strata often externalized the
notion of "the economy" to something that only the wealthy and
metropolitan participated in. "The economy" was not their job in a
local store; it was something that bankers did." (page 172)</p>

<p>"Later, it emerged that Facebook, in a panic about its PR crisis,
had hired the secret communications firm
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definers_Public_Affairs">Definers Public Affairs</a>, which subsequently leaked out fake
narratives filled with anti-Semitic tropes about its critics being
part of a George Soros-funded conspiracy." (page 229)</p>

<p>"Peter Thiel, the venture capitalist behind Facebook, Palantir, and
Paypal, spoke at length about how he no longer believes "that
freedom and democracy are compatible." And in elaborating his views
on technology companies, he expounded on how CEOs are the new
monarchs in a techno-feudal system of governance. We just don't call
them monarchies in public, he said, because "anything that's not
democracy makes people uncomfortable."" (page 237)</p>
