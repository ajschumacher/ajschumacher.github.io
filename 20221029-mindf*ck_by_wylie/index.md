# Mindf*ck, by Wylie

Cambridge Analytica was a US brand for the UK's SCL (Strategic
Communication Laboratories) Group. They [got][] Americans to fill out
personality surveys and install an app that sent them Facebook
information on likes, friends, etc. They used all this to advance the
agendas of [Steve Bannon][] and [Bob Mercer][], for example.

Facebook's crime in this seems to have been basically negligence. They
let a lot of information be accessible at the time, and people did
unsavory things with it. It's a little weird to call it a data breach,
since the system was working as intended.

I wonder how (or whether) Cambridge Analytica evaluated their
effectiveness... Trump became president, but was it _because of_
Cambridge Analytica? Or were they just pushing in a direction that
already had momentum? It is both horrifying and attractive to think
that manipulative actors are responsible for massive unpleasant
outcomes. But what share of the blame can be assigned?

The private messages bit is quite the unsupported claim.

Some of the [Big Five personality traits][] stuff reminded me of what
I've heard about [The Righteous Mind][]: describing Republicans as low
on openness and high on conscientiousness, while Democrats are the
reverse.

This idea—the just-world hypothesis considered harmful—is very
interesting.
