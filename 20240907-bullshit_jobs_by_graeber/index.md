# (Audio) Bullshit Jobs, by Graeber

> “There is only one success – to be able to spend your life in your
> own way.” (Christopher Morley)


[Graeber][] had a [popular article][] and this is the
[book version][]. As with [Rushkoff's][], the titular concept is
mostly a hook. I'm more interested in the [critique of work][]
generally.

The first part of the book, most directly on "bullshit jobs" and
related surveys and interviews, isn't very good, compared to Graeber's
[Debt][]. He wants to have it both ways, for one thing: We must trust
the people who say their jobs are bullshit, and at the same time not
trust people who say their jobs aren't.

Then there's the definition of a bullshit job, which is never done
quite consistently. I think it's supposed to be jobs that don't make
any difference (if they aren't done, nothing changes). But this bleeds
in at least two directions: Jobs where we may not _like_ the
difference they make, and jobs that _wouldn't_ be necessary if things
were set up differently.


So Graeber repeatedly criticizes Obama for using job preservation as a
reason to not completely upend the health care system. If the current
employees were all sent home, it would be bad: people wouldn't get
insurance reimbursement, etc. The current jobs are only (or primarily)
"bullshit" to Graeber because he thinks a single payer (or similar)
system could take care of people with fewer employees.


And while I know part of Graeber's point is to critique the Puritan
work ethic and "middle class thinking" in general, many of his
malcontent subjects just aren't very sympathetic.


Graeber did an academic thesis on "life cycle service," the historical
practice in northern Europe in which a young person would spend seven
or so years as an apprentice or servant, with some other family,
collecting some pay until they could set off on their own. I thought
this was interesting in relation to the modern idea of FIRE (Financial
Independence, Retire Early) in which a person similarly works for
others until they have enough money to be independent and then does
whatever they want.


Graeber talks a lot about "spiritual violence," and while this may be
worse when a job feels pointless (see also [Sayre's Law][]) I don't
think it's unique to "bullshit jobs" but common to any job that has
you doing what you really don't want to do. Hence the Morley quote
about success as being "able to spend your life in your own way."
People really like self-determination.

Graeber does connect at least a little bit with Black's
[Abolition of Work][] and the idea given book form in
[Fully Automated Luxury Communism][]. He spends some time on work as
caring work rather than factory production. And he also comes out in
support of UBI.
