# What are CFPs supposed to know?

To be a Certified Financial Planner, you have to have a bachelor's
degree (in anything) and do ([usually][]) seven [CFP Board][]-approved
classes and pass a test covering many [topics][]. The classes are
Fundamentals, Insurance, Investments, Tax, Retirement, Estate, and a
capstone case study class. Then you do 30 hours of continuing
education every two years.

The CFP Board [lists][] about 250 institutions with approved
offerings, mostly universities. These can be outsourced offerings, for
example from [Cerifi][]'s [Dalton Education][] or
[Greene Consulting][]'s [Financial Planner Program][] or [Zahn][].

There seem to be two main lines of textbooks. One is [Cerifi][]'s
[Money Education][], which [claims][] to by “chosen by 200
universities nationwide.” The [other][] is from
[National Underwriter][], mostly in their [Leimberg Library][]. There
used to be books from Keir, but they [joined forces][] with
[Money Education][].

From [Open Syllabus][], it isn't clear which books are most popular. I
find [one entry each][] for two of the Money Education books, and
[no mention][] of Leimberg books. It seems like [Kaplan][] and
[Danko][] also have materials, but may only offer them to participants
in their courses.

There are also lots of exam prep and study materials. [Zahn][] for
example makes supplemental books and flashcards, and Money Education
has “QuickSheets.”


There's also a thing called a financial calculator, which can be a
physical object that CFPs may learn to use.


For continuing education, every two years a CFP has to do 30 hours of
programs, selected from [thousands][] that are approved by the CFP
Board.
