<h1>Expert Python Programming by Jaworski and Ziadé</h1>
<p class="date">Sunday July  7, 2019</p>
<p>The authors use "half a loaf is better than none" on page 545 in reference to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-eventloop.html#asyncio.loop.run_in_executor"><code>run_in_executor</code></a>, and that saying is also applicable to their book. <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/expert-python-programming-third-edition">Expert Python Programming</a> is not a good book, but it's also not entirely without value.</p>
<p>The editing could be better. Either no native English speakers were involved, or they didn't have enough time to work with the Polish and French authors' prose. A next section promised on page 391 never appears. On page 546 there are two different next chapters. There's even a code block on page 576 that is printed with all the newlines stripped out.</p>
<p>Beyond simple issues, explanation is sometimes poor or missing. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket">token bucket</a> explanation is particularly unclear. They say that Python string concatenation is quadratic, but they don't explain <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44487537/why-does-naive-string-concatenation-become-quadratic-above-a-certain-length/44487738#44487738">why</a>. On page 496 they suggest that non-deterministic caching has been solved numerous times, so the reader can just go look on PyPI.</p>
<p>The publication date of this third edition is April 2019, and yet there's no mention of <a href="/20190629-using_pipenv/">Pipenv</a>. They <a href="https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1629#issue-161422224">still</a> say py.test rather than pytest. They mention nose but not nose2. Chunks of the book refer to Python 3.5, while the cover promises 3.7.</p>
<p>The perspective of the authors is unfamiliar to me, as when they say on page 187 that "Using binary bit-wise operations to combine options is common in Python."</p>
<p>I'd like to be able to trust the completeness of a book like this. If it doesn't know about Pipenv, what else is it missing that should really be included?</p>
<p>But it isn't all bad. I don't recall seeing the Python 3.7 <code>asyncio.run()</code>, but the larger-scale explanations of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html"><code>asyncio</code></a> weren't awful. If I'm understanding properly, the interesting thing about <code>await</code> is that it <em>doesn't</em> wait, in the sense of blocking.</p>
<p>So I'm not upset that I read the book. I suspect the authors are technically competent people who did the best they could with limited resources from <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/">Packt</a>. The book contains their take on things, and it broadened what I was aware of.</p>
