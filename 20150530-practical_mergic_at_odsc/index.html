<p>Hi! I'm Aaron. This is my blog and <a href="https://twitter.com/planarrowspace">my twitter handle</a>. You can get from one to the other. <a href="big.html">This presentation</a> and a corresponding write-up (you're reading it) are on my blog (which you're on).</p>
<p>I've also done a <a href="/20150520-practical_mergic/">longer version</a> and a <a href="/20150514-mergic/">shorter version</a> of this talk, and those are also on the blog. So if you find yourself wanting more you can get more, and if you want less I can also give you less.</p>
<p>This is probably the cheekiest of the three versions.</p>
<hr />
<p><img width="1000%" alt="Open Data Science Conference title slide for Practical Mergic with Aaron Schumacher" src="img/title_slide.png" /></p>
<hr />
<p>Here's an official cover slide.</p>
<hr />
<p><img height="1000%" alt="Metis" src="img/metis.png" /></p>
<hr />
<p>I teach at <a href="http://www.thisismetis.com/">Metis</a>, and I'm really happy that we're helping sponsor the Open Data Science Conference. Metis is a data science bootcamp, currently just in New York (sorry Boston). We get the best people, we have a lot of fun, and at the end out come data scientists that you could hire.</p>
<p>I could just talk about Metis, but instead I thought it'd be a good idea to talk about un-sexy everyday problems.</p>
<hr />
<p>problem</p>
<hr />
<p>In general it's just one problem, and if you work with data you have this problem.</p>
<hr />
<p>your data sucks</p>
<hr />
<p>Data is awful! You do not want to swim in a data lake. It's a mess out there!</p>
<p>Of course these days we have open data, which is a huge improvement.</p>
<hr />
<p>our data sucks</p>
<hr />
<p>So maybe we release some data sets, put them on a nice Socrata open data portal...</p>
<hr />
<pre><code class="language-text">   dbn grade year category num_tested
01M019     3 2010   Female         16
01M019     3 2010     Male         20
01M019     3 2010     Male          2</code></pre>

<hr />
<p>Here's an example of open data <a href="http://schools.nyc.gov/NR/exeres/05289E74-2D81-4CC0-81F6-E1143E28F4C4,frameless.htm">released</a> by the New York City Department of Education.</p>
<p>The <code>dbn</code> is a school identifier, and <code>grade</code> and <code>year</code> make sense. This file has the number of students tested in three categories: “Female”, “Male”, and “Male”.</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>There are fourteen hundred extra “Male” rows like this!</p>
<p>You can look more deeply into this and conclude with some confidence that you can probably drop these extra “Male” rows. It's clearly a mistake of some kind.</p>
<hr />
<p><img width="1000%" title="This happens." src="img/this_happens.png" /></p>
<hr />
<p><em>Original image from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnolia_%28film%29">Magnolia</a> via <a href="http://indie-outlook.com/2012/09/19/jeremy-blackman-on-magnolia-pta-0s-1s-and-pink-drink/">Indie Outlook</a>.</em></p>
<p>This is a scene from a movie called Magnolia where it's raining frogs. One of the things they say in that movie is that strange things happen, and if you've worked with any variety of data sets, you've probably encountered very strange things indeed. You need to check everything—including things that you shouldn’t have to check.</p>
<p>I would also like to offer, before I get to what I'm really going to talk about, that it is a serious problem that I can't easily contribute a fix to that DOE data set. We should expect collaborative checking and editing of data sets to be part of the benefit of open data.</p>
<p>I don't know of any system currently in existence that does this well. We need something in between Wikipedia and GitHub. The <a href="http://dat-data.com/">dat project</a> isn't doing it, at least not yet. I like the architecture of <a href="http://www.datomic.com/">Datomic</a>, but it's not quite right either. <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/">Wikidata</a> might be moving in the right direction, but I'm not sure yet.</p>
<hr />
<p>problems when names are the same</p>
<hr />
<p>How is this relevant to merging? Well, lots of things can go wrong when you have exact duplicates that you aren't expecting.</p>
<hr />
<p>merge</p>
<hr />
<p>One big reason to want nice unique IDs is that you would like to merge two data sets, and you need something to match records by. Let's do a quick refresher on merging, or joining.</p>
<hr />
<p><img height="1000%" title="dplyr cheat sheet joins" src="img/dplyr_joins.png" /></p>
<hr />
<p>This is a section from <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a>'s <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/">cheatsheet</a> for <a href="https://github.com/hadley/dplyr">dplyr</a>. These cheatsheets are fantastic.</p>
<p>We'll do a merge between two data sets. For simplicity say that they have one column which is an identifier for each row, and some data in other columns. There are a couple ways we can join the data.</p>
<p>Some people like to think about these in terms of Venn diagrams.</p>
<hr />
<p><img width="1000%" title="left join" src="img/left_join.png" /></p>
<hr />
<p>This picture comes from <a href="https://twitter.com/codinghorror">Jeff Atwood</a>'s post called <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/a-visual-explanation-of-sql-joins/">visual explanation of SQL joins</a>.</p>
<p>A former co-worker told me that seeing these pictures changed his life. I hope you like them.</p>
<p>This is a left join: you get all the keys from the left data set, regardless of whether they're in the right data set.</p>
<hr />
<p><img width="1000%" title="right join" src="img/right_join.png" /></p>
<hr />
<p>Jeff Atwood doesn't have a picture of a right join on his blog, but you can make one with a little <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/">ImageMagick</a>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ convert -rotate 180 left_join.png right_join.png</code></pre>

<p>You're welcome.</p>
<hr />
<p><img width="1000%" title="inner join" src="img/inner_join.png" /></p>
<hr />
<p>An inner join, or natural join, only gives you results for keys that appear in both the left and right data sets.</p>
<hr />
<p><img width="1000%" title="outer join" src="img/outer_join.png" /></p>
<hr />
<p>And an outer join gives you everything. Great!</p>
<p>There are a few other terms we could add, but let's not.</p>
<hr />
<p><img height="1000%" title="dplyr cheat sheet joins" src="img/dplyr_joins.png" /></p>
<hr />
<p>Here's the <code>dplyr</code> summary again. You can see how you can introduce missing values when doing left, right, and outer joins.</p>
<p>Ready? Here's a test.</p>
<hr />
<p>How many rows do you get when you outer join two tables?</p>
<hr />
<p>Think about this question, discuss it with somebody near you, come up with everything you can say about the number of rows you might expect when you join two tables. Introduce any quantities you think you'd like to know.</p>
<p>Take about three minutes and then come back.</p>
<p><em>three minutes pass</em></p>
<p>Say there are \( N \) rows in the first table and \( M \) rows in the second table. Then the smallest number of rows we can get from the outer join is the greater of \( N \) and \( M \). But we might get as many as \( N \cdot M \) rows, if all the keys are the same!</p>
<p>If you said the maximum was \( N + M \), you were probably assuming, implicitly or explicitly, that all they keys were unique. This is a common assumption that you should really check.</p>
<hr />
<pre><code class="language-r">> nrow(first)
## [1] 3
> nrow(second)
## [1] 3
> result &lt;- merge(first, second)
> nrow(result)
## [1] 3</code></pre>

<hr />
<p><em>This code is runnable in <a href="count_trouble.R">count_trouble.R</a>.</em></p>
<p>Is it enough to check the numbers of rows when we do joins?</p>
<p>This does an inner join, which is the default for <code>merge</code> in R. (I'm using R here as a personal favor to <a href="https://twitter.com/jaredlander">Jared Lander</a>.)</p>
<p>Think about it.</p>
<hr />
<pre><code class="language-text"> x    y1        x   y2        x    y1   y2
 1 looks        1 good        1 looks good
 2    oh        2  boy        2    oh  boy
 3  well        2   no        2    oh   no</code></pre>

<hr />
<p>There is no peace while you don't have unique IDs.</p>
<p>There are times when you don't want every ID to be unique in a table, but really really often you do. You probably want to check that uniqueness explicitly.</p>
<hr />
<p>problems when names are the same</p>
<hr />
<p>This has been a discussion of problems arising from names being the same.</p>
<hr />
<p>problems when names aren't the same</p>
<hr />
<p>And now, you probably also want to check that the intersection you get is what you expect.</p>
<p>You don't want to silently drop a ton of rows when you merge!</p>
<p>This is the beginning of our problems with names that aren't the same.</p>
<hr />
<p>let's play tennis</p>
<hr />
<p>I downloaded the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Tennis+Major+Tournament+Match+Statistics">Tennis Major Tournament Match Statistics Data Set</a> from the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/">University of California, Irvine Machine Learning Repository</a>.</p>
<p>Do you know the process for getting a data set up up on the UCI ML repository?</p>
<p>The process is this: You fill in a form on their web site, and then maybe they put up your data set.</p>
<hr />
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ head -2 AusOpen-women-2013.csv | cut -c 1-40
## Player1,Player2,Round,Result,FNL1,FNL2,F
## Serena Williams,Ashleigh Barty,1,1,2,0,5

$ head -2 USOpen-women-2013.csv | cut -c 1-40
## Player 1,Player 2,ROUND,Result,FNL.1,FNL
## S Williams,V Azarenka,7,1,2,1,57,44,43,2</code></pre>

<hr />
<p>There are eight files like this. You can see that the player names are not perfectly consistent.</p>
<p>Some good people up-state New York contributed this data set, and I got in touch with them. I was curious about where the data came from; it was scraped from some web sites. Did they use it in any of their classes? Yes, it was used for some activities. Did they use it for teaching any particular data cleaning techniques? I haven't heard back since then.</p>
<hr />
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ wc -l names.txt
## 1886

$ sort names.txt | uniq | wc -l
## 669</code></pre>

<hr />
<p>So we'll take the tennis player names as our example data set. We have a file with 1,886 names, 669 of which are unique.</p>
<p>There are too many unique strings—sometimes more than one string for the same player. As a result, a count of the most common names will not accurately tell us who played the most in these 2013 tennis competitions.</p>
<hr />
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ sort names.txt | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -5
##  21 Rafael Nadal
##  17 Stanislas Wawrinka
##  17 Novak Djokovic
##  17 David Ferrer
##  15 Roger Federer</code></pre>

<hr />
<p>The list above is not the answer we’re looking for. We want to be correct.</p>
<hr />
<p>single field deduplication</p>
<hr />
<p>We're going to think about this problem, which is pretty common, of de-duplicating (or making a merge table for) a single text field.</p>
<hr />
<pre><code>Lukas Lacko             F Pennetta
Leonardo Mayer          S Williams
Marcos Baghdatis        C Wozniacki
Santiago Giraldo        E Bouchard
Juan Monaco             N.Djokovic
Dmitry Tursunov         S.Giraldo
Dudi Sela               Y-H.Lu
Fabio Fognini           T.Robredo
...                     ...</code></pre>

<hr />
<p>To be clear, the problem looks like this. And the problem often looks like this: You have either two columns with slightly different versions of identifiers, or one long list of things that you need to resolve to common names. These problems are fundamentally the same.</p>
<p>Do you see the match here? (It's Santiago!)</p>
<p>So we need to find the strings that refer to the same person.</p>
<hr />
<p><img width="1000%" title="Open Refine" src="img/open_refine.png" /></p>
<hr />
<p><a href="http://openrefine.org/">Open Refine</a> is quite good.</p>
<p>An interesting side story is that Open Refine was formerly Google Refine, and before that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaweb">Metaweb</a>'s “Freebase Gridworks”. Google is shutting down <a href="http://www.freebase.com/">Freebase</a>, and we have to hope that <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/">Wikidata</a> will then be the open match for Google's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_Graph">Knowledge Graph</a>.</p>
<p>Open Refine is quite good, but there are several things I wish it did differently.</p>
<p>For one, although it has an internal record of changes, the interface Open Refine exposes changes your data in place. That's not okay.</p>
<hr />
<pre><code class="language-text">Cluster ID,name
1,Lukas Lacko
2,Leonardo Mayer
3,Marcos Baghdatis
...</code></pre>

<hr />
<p>One way to keep output from a deduplication process is a merge table like this. The <code>csvdedupe</code> interface on the Python <a href="https://github.com/datamade/dedupe">dedupe</a> project from <a href="http://datamade.us/">DataMade</a> in Chicago will give you this kind of output. It's much better than no accessible record of the transformation, but it's also not a format I want to look at, as a human.</p>
<hr />
<pre><code class="language-json">{
    "Ann's group": [
        "Ann"
    ],
    "Bob's group": [
        "Bob",
        "Robert"
    ]
}</code></pre>

<hr />
<p>Here's a format that I propose could be usable for describing deduplication. It's as readable by humans as any <a href="http://json.org/">JSON</a>, and it can be easily produced and consumed by anything that speaks JSON, which is everything.</p>
<hr />
<pre><code class="language-text">new,original
Ann's group,Ann
Bob's group,Bob
Bob's group,Robert</code></pre>

<hr />
<p>You can still produce a merge table from the JSON representation, and it will have whatever new keys you specify, possibly human-readable ones.</p>
<hr />
<p><img height="1000%" title="ermahgerd mergic" src="img/ermahgerd.png" /></p>
<hr />
<p><code>mergic</code> is a tool that supports doing deduplication with these conventions.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>simple</li>
<li>customizable</li>
<li>reproducible</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>The goals of <code>mergic</code> are to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>simple, meaning largely text-based and obvious; the tool disappears</li>
<li>customizable, meaning you can easily use a custom distance function</li>
<li>reproducible, meaning everything you do can be done again automatically</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>the tool disappears</p>
<hr />
<p>Good tools disappear.</p>
<p>Whatever text editor you use, the your work product is a text file. You can use any text editor, or use different ones for different purposes, and so on.</p>
<p>Your merge process shouldn't rely on any particular piece of software for its replicability.</p>
<hr />
<p>any distance function</p>
<hr />
<p>Your distance function can make all the difference. You need to be able to plug in any distance function that works well for your data.</p>
<hr />
<p>really reproducible</p>
<hr />
<p>People can see what's happening, and computers can keep doing the process without clicking or re-running particular executables.</p>
<hr />
<p><img width="1000%" title="big data" src="img/big_data.png" /></p>
<hr />
<p>A quick disclaimer!</p>
<p>This is John Langford's slide, about what big data is. He says that small data is data for which \( O(n^2) \) algorithms are feasible. Currently <code>mergic</code> is strictly for this kind of "artisanal" data, where we want to ensure that our matching is correct but want to reduce the amount of human work to ensure that. And we are about to get very \( O(n^2) \).</p>

...</code></pre>

<hr />
<p>So we make all possible pairs of identifiers!</p>
<p>One of the things that Open Refine gets right is that it doesn't show us humans all the pairs it's looking at.</p>
<p>All these pairs are annoying for a computer, and awful for humans. The computer can calculate a lot of pairwise distances, but I don't want to look at all the pairs.</p>
<p>Do you see the match here? (It's Santiago again!)</p>
<hr />
<pre><code>Karolina Pliskova,K Pliskova</code></pre>

<hr />
<p>Aside from being a drag to look at, there's a bigger problem with verifying equality on a pairwise basis.</p>
<p>Do these two records refer to the same person? (Tennis fans may see where I'm going with this.)</p>
<hr />
<pre><code>Kristyna Pliskova,K Pliskova</code></pre>

<hr />
<p>Karolina has a twin sister, and Kristyna also plays professional tennis! This may well not be obvious if you only look at pairs individually. What matters is the set of names that are transitively judged as equal.</p>
<hr />
<p>sets &gt; pairs</p>
<hr />
<p>Both perceptually and logically, it's better to think in sets than in a bunch of individual pairs.</p>
<hr />
<p>workflow support for reproducible deduplication and merging</p>
<hr />
<p>This is what <code>mergic</code> is for. <code>mergic</code> is a simple tool designed to make it less painful when you need to merge things that don't yet merge.</p>
<hr />
<p>demo: mergic tennis</p>
<hr />
<p>With all that background, let's see how <code>mergic</code> attempts to support a good workflow.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ pew new odsc</code></pre>

<p>I'll start by making a new <a href="https://virtualenv.pypa.io/">virtual environment</a> using <a href="https://github.com/berdario/pew">pew</a>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ pip install mergic</code></pre>

<p><code>mergic</code> is very new (version 0.0.6) and it currently installs with no extra dependencies.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ mergic -h</code></pre>

<p><code>mergic</code> includes a command-line script based on <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/argparse.html">argparse</a> that uses a default string distance function.</p>
<pre><code>usage: mergic [-h] {calc,make,check,diff,apply,table} ...

positional arguments:
  {calc,make,check,diff,apply,table}
    calc                calculate all partitions of data
    make                make a JSON partition from data
    check               check validity of JSON partition
    diff                diff two JSON partitions
    apply               apply a patch to a JSON partition
    table               make merge table from JSON partition

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit</code></pre>

<p>In the tennis data, names appear sometimes with full first names and sometimes with only first initials. To get good comparisons, we should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transform all the data to the same format, as nearly as possible.</li>
<li>Use a good distance on the transformed data.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can do both of these things with a simple custom script, <a href="tennis/tennis_mergic.py">tennis_mergic.py</a>. It only <a href="requirements.txt">requires</a> the <code>mergic</code> and <code>python-Levenshtein</code> packages.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">#!/usr/bin/env python

import re
import Levenshtein
import mergic


def first_initial_last(name):
    initial = re.match("^[A-Z]", name).group()
    last = re.search("(?&lt;=[ .])[A-Z].+$", name).group()
    return "{}. {}".format(initial, last)


def distance(x, y):
    x = first_initial_last(x)
    y = first_initial_last(y)
    return Levenshtein.distance(x, y)


mergic.Blender(distance).script()</code></pre>

<p>Note that there's a transformation step in there, normalizing the form of the names to have just a first initial and last name. This kind of normalization can be very important.</p>
<p>As a more extreme example, a friend of mine has used the following transform: Google it. Then you can use a distance on the result set to deduplicate.</p>
<p>Now <a href="tennis/tennis_mergic.py">tennis_mergic.py</a> can be used just like the standard <code>mergic</code> script.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ ./tennis_mergic.py calc names.txt
## num groups, max group, num pairs, cutoff

##          1,       669,    223446, 12</code></pre>

<p>There is a clear best cutoff here, as the size of the max group jumps from 6 items to 85 and the number of within-group comparisons jumps from 470 to 5,117. So we create a partition where the Levenshtein distance between names in our standard first initial and last name format is no more than two, and put the result in a file called <code>groups.json</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ ./tennis_mergic.py make names.txt 2 > groups.json</code></pre>

<p>This kind of JSON grouping file could be produced and edited by anything, not just <code>mergic</code>.</p>
<p>As expected, the proposed grouping has combined things over-zealously in some places:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ head -5 groups.json

##         "Di Wu",
##         "Yen-Hsun Lu",
##         "Y-H.Lu",</code></pre>

<p>Manual editing can produce a corrected version of the original grouping, which could be saved as <code>edited.json</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ head -8 edited.json
## {
##     "Yen-Hsun Lu": [
##         "Yen-Hsun Lu",
##         "Y-H.Lu"
##     ],
##     "Di Wu": [
##         "Di Wu"
##     ],</code></pre>

<p>Parts of the review process would be difficult or impossible for a computer to do accurately.</p>
<p>After editing, you can check that the new grouping is still valid. At this stage we aren't using anything custom any more, so the default <code>mergic</code> is fine:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ mergic check edited.json
## 669 items in 354 groups</code></pre>

<p>The <code>mergic</code> diffing tools make it easy to make comparisons that would otherwise be difficult, letting us focus on and save only changes that are human reviewers make rather than whole files.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ mergic diff groups.json edited.json > diff.json</code></pre>

<p>Now <code>diff.json</code> only has the entries that represent changes from the original <code>groups.json</code>.</p>
<p>The edited version can be reconstructed from the original and the diff with <code>mergic apply</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ mergic apply groups.json diff.json > rebuilt.json</code></pre>

<p>The order of <code>rebuilt.json</code> may not be identical to the original <code>edited.json</code>, but the diff will be empty, meaning the file is equivalent:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ mergic diff edited.json rebuilt.json
## {}</code></pre>

<p>Finally, to generate a CSV merge table that you'll be able to use with any other tool:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ mergic table edited.json > merge.csv</code></pre>

<p>Now the file <code>merge.csv</code> has two columns, <code>original</code> and <code>mergic</code>, where <code>original</code> contains all the values that appeared in the original data and <code>mergic</code> contains the deduplicated keys. You can join this on to your original data and go to town.</p>
<p>Here's how we might do that to quickly get a list of who played the most in these 2013 tennis events:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ join -t, &lt;(sort names.txt) &lt;(sort merge.csv) | cut -d, -f2 | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head
##  24 Novak Djokovic
##  22 Rafael Nadal
##  21 Serena Williams
##  21 David Ferrer
##  20 Na Li
##  19 Victoria Azarenka
##  19 Agnieszka Radwanska
##  18 Stanislas Wawrinka
##  17 Tommy Robredo
##  17 Sloane Stephens</code></pre>

<p>Note that this is not the same as the result we got before resolving these name issues:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ sort names.txt | uniq -c | sort -nr | head
##  21 Rafael Nadal
##  17 Stanislas Wawrinka
##  17 Novak Djokovic
##  17 David Ferrer
##  15 Roger Federer
##  14 Tommy Robredo
##  13 Richard Gasquet
##  11 Victoria Azarenka
##  11 Tomas Berdych
##  11 Serena Williams</code></pre>

<p>As it happens, using a cutoff of 0 and doing no hand editing will still give the correct top ten. In general the desired result and desired level of certainty in its correctness will inform the level of effort that is justified.</p>
<hr />
<p>distance matters</p>
<hr />
<p>Having a good distance function might be the most important thing. It's hard to imagine a machine learning as good a distance function as you could just right based on your human intelligence.</p>
<p>There is work on learnable edit distances; notably there's a current Python project to implement hidden alignment conditional random fields for classifying string pairs: <a href="https://github.com/dirko/pyhacrf">pyhacrf</a>. Python dedupe is <a href="https://github.com/datamade/dedupe/issues/14">eager</a> to incorporate this.</p>
<p>See also: <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/ml/papers/marlin-kdd-03.pdf">Adaptive Duplicate Detection Using Learnable String Similarity Measures</a></p>
<hr />
<p>extension to multiple fields</p>
<hr />
<p>We've been talking about single field deduplication.</p>
<hr />
<pre><code class="language-text">name
----
Bob
Rob
Robert</code></pre>

<hr />
<p>This means that we have one field, say name.</p>
<hr />
<pre><code class="language-text">name, name
----------
Bob, Bobby
Bob, Robert
Bobby, Robert</code></pre>

<hr />
<p>And we look at all the possible pairs and calculate those pairwise distances.</p>
<hr />
<p><img width="1000%" title="one dimensional" src="img/one_dimensional.png" /></p>
<hr />
<p>While we described it even in Open Refine as “clustering”, we've really been doing a classification task: either a pair is in the same group or they aren't. We've had one dimension, and we hope that we can just divide true connections from different items with a simple cutoff.</p>
<hr />
<pre><code class="language-text">name,    hometown
-----------------
Bob,     New York
Rob,     NYC
Robert,  "NY, NY"</code></pre>

<hr />
<p>Often, there's more than one field involved, and it might be good to treat all the fields separately.</p>
<p>So let's calculate distances between each field entry for each pair of rows, in this case.</p>
<hr />
<p><img height="1000%" title="two dimensional" src="img/two_dimensional.png" /></p>
<hr />
<p>The reason it might be good to treat the fields separately is that they might be more useful together; we might be able to classify all the true duplicates using the information from both fields.</p>
<p>Maybe you can find two clusters, one for true duplicates and one for different items.</p>
<p>Or maybe you could get some training data and use whatever classification algorithm you like.</p>
<p>The Python <a href="https://github.com/datamade/dedupe">dedupe</a> project and the R <a href="">RecordLinkage</a> package do this.</p>
<p>The <code>csvdedupe</code> interface using <code>dedupe</code> even asks us to clarify things, doing a live training phase. The hope is that it will learn what matters.</p>
<p>You can also build this kind of behavior into your own systems; there is an <a href="http://datamade.github.io/dedupe-examples/docs/csv_example.html">example</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p>real clustering?</p>
<hr />
<p>The “clustering” that we've been doing hasn't been much like usual clustering.</p>
<hr />
<p><img width="1000%" title="one dimensional" src="img/one_dimensional.png" /></p>
<hr />
<p>In part, this is because we we've only had distances between strings without having a real “string space”.</p>
<p>I'm going to just sketch out this direction; I think it's interesting but I haven't seen any real results in it yet.</p>
<hr />
<p>dog, doge, kitten, kitteh</p>
<hr />
<p>Say these are the items we're working with. We can use Levenshtein edit distance to make a distance matrix.</p>
<hr />
<pre><code class="language-text">       dog doge kitten kitteh
   dog   0    1      6      6
  doge   1    0      5      5
kitten   6    5      0      1
kitteh   6    5      1      0</code></pre>

<hr />
<p>So here's a distance matrix, and it looks the way we'd expect. But we still don't have <em>coordinates</em> for our words.</p>
<p>Luckily, there is at least one technique for coming up with coordinates when you have a distance matrix. Let's use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidimensional_scaling">multidimensional scaling</a>! There's a nice <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/manifold/plot_mds.html">implementation in sklearn</a>.</p>
<hr />
<pre><code class="language-python">from sklearn.manifold import MDS
mds = MDS(dissimilarity='precomputed')
coords = mds.fit_transform(distances)</code></pre>

<hr />
<p>Here's all the code it takes.</p>
<hr />
<p><img width="1000%" title="MDS coordinates from distance matrix" src="img/mds_words.png" /></p>
<hr />
<p>And here's the result! This is at least a fun visualization, and I wonder if doing clustering in a space like this might sometimes lead to better results.</p>
<p>The key thing here is that we're clustering on the elements themselves, rather than indirectly via the pairwise distances.</p>
<p>There are other ways of getting coordinates for words. This includes the very interesting <a href="https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/">word2vec</a> and related techniques.</p>
<p>Also, you might have items are already naturally coordinates, for example if you have medical data like a person's height or weight.</p>
<hr />

<hr />
<p>This is the Open Data Science Conference, right?</p>
<p>This mergic project is something I think could be a good direction for particular kinds of data problems. Of course it's <a href="https://github.com/ajschumacher/mergic">on GitHub</a> and of course I'd love help in making it something that might actually help people.</p>
<p>Our community is bigger than any one problem or any one solution, and I want to hear about what problems are real for you and what solutions you're excited about.</p>
