# Elder Race, by Tchaikovsky

As mentioned in its dedication, Tchaikovsky's 2021 short novel
[Elder Race][] is heavily inspired by Wolfe's 1967 story
[Trip, Trap][]. What's new?

 * Some female characters instead of all-male cast
 * Lots of exploration of using technology to fight depression
 * Last of high-tech civilization is protagonist rather than villain
 * Villain is less familiar than "just" a telepathic alien

Both explore the idea of advanced technology being indistinguishable
from magic (Arthur C. Clarke's quote) with fantasy and sci-fi POV
characters. Perhaps the most interesting thing about both stories, and
perhaps more so Elder Race, is the idea that there is a level of
understanding well beyond that of the high-tech human "wizard."

Mostly it's straightforward fun though. In the end they destroy what
they don't understand and live happily ever after.
