<h1>Learn You a Haskell for Great Good! by Lipovača</h1>
<p class="date">Sunday April 11, 2021</p>
<p>Here's a good <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/">book</a> you can read for free. Like it says on the
back, "Maps, Monads, Monoids, and More!" It does a great job
explaining things in ways that are helpful. The humble list can be a
functor, an applicative functor, a monoid, and a monad.</p>
<p>There's a <a href="http://james-iry.blogspot.com/2009/05/brief-incomplete-and-mostly-wrong.html">joke</a>: "A monad is just a monoid in the category of
endofunctors, what's the problem?" This is like saying "the median is
just a medoid on the field of reals."</p>
<p>In both cases, if you don't know what the first term is, you likely
don't know what the others are. It's not a good way to explain.</p>
<p>In both cases, the explanatory terms are needlessly obscure: "endo" is
likely gratuitous; "field of reals" is probably not better than
"numbers".</p>
<p>Also in both cases, the explanation isn't complete; it describes
without defining. For the median, the L1 norm has to be specified. For
monads, the monoid function has to be <code>join</code>. See also
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3870088/a-monad-is-just-a-monoid-in-the-category-of-endofunctors-whats-the-problem">Crockett's explanation</a> and my <a href="/20150125-monads_by_diagram/">pictures</a> showing how <code>map</code> and
<code>join</code> give you <code>bind</code>.</p>
<p>I'm not giving a complete explanation here either. Read the book! It
has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipper_(data_structure)">zippers</a> too!</p>
<hr />
<p><img alt="cover" src="cover.jpg" /></p>
<hr />
<p>Forcing non-pure stuff into <code>do</code> blocks, as seems common in Haskell,
is very reminiscent of the <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/functional-core-imperative-shell">functional core, imperative shell</a>
pattern.</p>
<hr />
<p>Haskell's pattern-matching (often instead of conditionals) is pretty
neat. Python is getting <a href="https://mathspp.com/blog/pydonts/pattern-matching-tutorial-for-pythonic-code">something analogous</a> in 3.10.</p>
<hr />
<p>Haskell's type inference gives behavior sort of like coercion in other
languages, but without the craziness. So <code>3 + 4.5</code> will work like
you'd expect, but there's no chance <code>'3' + 4.5</code> will turn out to be
<code>'34.5'</code> (which is what happens in JavaScript).</p>
<hr />
<p>Haskell has a funny quirk in some of its ranges:</p>
<pre><code>ghci> [0.1, 0.3 .. 1]
[0.1,0.3,0.5,0.7,0.8999999999999999,1.0999999999999999]</code></pre>

<p>It's surprising that 1.1 is in there, when 1 was the upper bound. This
is because of a rule that if the value is within half the step size
(for floats and things like them) then it gets included in the result.
Wacky!</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>Sets and maps from <code>Data.Set</code> and <code>Data.map</code> are implemented using
trees, but instead of normal binary search trees, they use</em> balanced
<em>binary search trees.</em>" (page 135)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interesting! Usually these would be hash maps... Hmm! The closest
Haskell gets to a "normal" hash map (I think <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/unordered-containers-0.2.13.0/docs/Data-HashMap-Strict.html">this</a>?) is implemented
with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_array_mapped_trie">hash array mapped tries</a>. Also good for persistence (meaning
re-using things in memory rather than creating everything from
scratch, because we don’t mutate). Fun!</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"We can read the type of <code>putStrLn</code> like this: <code>putStrLn</code> takes a
string and returns an <em>I/O action</em> that has a result type of <code>()</code>
(that is, the empty tuple, also known as <em>unit</em>)." (page 155)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The wiki for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_type">unit type</a> is helpful for understanding why it's
called that.</p>
<hr />
<p>On page 275, he defines a pipe operator with <code>x -: f = f x</code>. Pretty
neat!</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"While similar to a normal list, a <em>difference list</em> is actually a
function that takes a list and prepends another list to it. For
example, the difference list equivalent of a list like <code>[1,2,3]</code> is
the function <code>\xs -&gt; [1,2,3] ++ xs</code>. A normal empty list is <code>[]</code>,
whereas an empty difference list is the function <code>\xs -&gt; [] ++ xs</code>."
(page 307)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so we get efficient appending to linked lists!</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"the function monad is also called the <em>reader monad</em>." (page 312)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"For instance, if we have <code>Just (Just 9)</code>, can we make that into
<code>Just 9</code>? It turns out that any nested monadic value can be
flattened and that this is actually a property unique to monads."
(page 326)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This makes it sound fancier than it is, I think because the author
talks about <code>bind</code> more than <code>join</code> and doesn't talk about the
<a href="/20150125-monads_by_diagram/">relationship between them</a>.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"We don't usually set out to make a monad with the sole purpose of
making a monad. Rather, we make a type whose purpose is to model an
aspect of some problem, and then later on, if we see that the type
represents a value with a context and can act like a monad, we give
it a <code>Monad</code> instance." (page 336)</p>
