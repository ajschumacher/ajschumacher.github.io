# Sea of Tranquility, by Mandel

[Sea of Tranquility][] is a lot of fun. There's a good deal of amusing
[autofiction][], and fun mystery and sci-fi aspects. I have a fondness
for time travel. It's not very long, and it reads really quickly.

I agree with the author's take on the [simulation hypothesis][], which
is that it doesn't really matter. I think, therefore I am. I think
consciousness is a mysterious, special, and important part of this.

You can tell it's sci-fi because in the future there are airships.
There always have to be airships. [Mandel][]'s airships are not just
dirigibles though! They're fast enough for daily global commutes.
Exciting. More is not explained.

> "“My personal belief is that we turn to postapocalyptic fiction not

> "A life lived in a simulation is still a life." (page 210)
