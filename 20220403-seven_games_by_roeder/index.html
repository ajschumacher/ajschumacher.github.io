<h1>Seven Games, by Roeder</h1>
<p class="date">Sunday April  3, 2022</p>
<p><a href="https://oroeder.github.io/">Roeder</a> writes about checkers, chess, go, backgammon, poker,
scrabble, and bridge. He gets philosophical, on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_Ludens">Homo ludens</a> and
what AI is and so on. It's interesting and I learned about some game
variations that are fun to try. Quality pandemic book.</p>

<p>"I’m a machine and you’re a machine and we both think, don’t we?"
(epigraph, quoting Claude Shannon, when asked whether machines could
think)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"games offer a space to enjoy agency." (page 9)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Games also offer simplified models of a dauntingly complicated
world," (page 82)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"a game is “the voluntary attempt to overcome unnecessary
obstacles.”" (page 11)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"adding structure to play—that is, inventing and playing games—is
central to our developmental intelligence." (page 12)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Ken Thompson, the designer of the Unix operating system and a chess
machine called Belle, once spent an hour a day for three years
keying in lines from the Encyclopedia of Chess Openings." (page 35)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Shannon’s paper described two strategies for programming a computer
to play chess. Type A programs employed brute-force search and
evaluation, analyzing every possible move, and all possible
subsequent moves, no matter how unpromising they might look to a
human observer. In other words, they exploited the computer’s chief
strength: sheer calculation. Shannon, however, thought such a player
would be “both slow and weak.” Type B programs were more selective,
examining only certain small yet promising branches on chess’s
enormous tree. In other words, they exploited something like human
intuition. Early computer scientists thought the successful players
would be Type B, but with the rapid expansion of computing power,
computer scientists were lured into pursuing Type A." (page 69)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The key to elite chess is preparation, which Stockfish
facilitates." (page 84)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"“My own works have been described as works of emptiness, but it is
not to be taken for the nihilism of the West,”" (page 100, quoting
<a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/literature/1968/kawabata/lecture/" title="Japan, the Beautiful and Myself">Kawabata</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"“I feel something very strange,” Fan said afterward. “I lose with
the program and I don’t understand myself anymore.”" (page 102)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"The rules of Go—called weiqi in Chinese, igo in Japanese, and baduk
in Korean—are stark and elegant, as if they were discovered rather
than invented." (page 102)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Compare to ideas of math being discovered vs. invented...</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Even Confucius begrudgingly agreed that playing Go was better than
sitting idle." (page 105)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Backgammon is one of only two things in life, I heard many times
during my research, that one never tires of." (page 153)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"In the end, of course, it was futile. Tesauro, whose research
inspired XG, expressed a similar sentiment about human players in
light of essentially perfect AI. “They play tournaments and they
study very hard,” he said. “I just don’t see the point.”" (page 160)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Chance, in other words, is a fertile garden in which human ego and
delusion flourish." (page 162)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Before bots, everybody believed that they were the best player. The
type of people we have now are people who like to study, who enjoy
the process of improving their own game." (pages 163-164)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"I came to understand that the appeal of this game, like the method
used to train its AI players, is not winning but learning." (page
165)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"The actual lived experience of the World Series of Poker, however,
comprises five elemental modes: loneliness, boredom, waiting,
folding, and, ultimately, devastation." (page 172)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"As the great player Marlon Hill once said about learning the
Scrabble words’ definitions, “If you are sane at all, it will drive
you slowly insane.”" (page 213)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"First, Scrabble, like life, is a trade-off between today and
tomorrow—between spending and saving." (page 221)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>"Next to him on the table was a plastic box containing bottles of
something called D-cycloserine, a molecule that, online, is
purported to enhance brain activity and learning; something called
F-phenibut, another brain booster and the subject of many personal
drug-experience website accounts that is said to aid memory;" (page
228)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Moreover, these languages must be common knowledge. You and your
partner must reveal your dialect’s structure and intricacies to your
opponents, and players are allowed to ask questions of their
opponents like “What did that bid mean?” Bridge is a game of
communication but not of subterfuge. As such, the “gravest possible
offense” in bridge, according to its official rules, is exchanging
information with one’s partner outside of what the rules allow—that
is, outside of the formal and public bidding process. Illicit
language is the cardinal sin of the game." (page 247)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"A sociological principle called Sayre’s law holds that disputes in
academia are so bitter because the stakes are so low." (page 264)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"“I believe that when I say ‘mathematics’ and when Pam or Tim says
‘God,’ we are talking about the same thing. And I mean the very same
thing. In both cases we are talking about the stunningly beautiful
order that underlies the universe.”" (page 267, quoting Matt
Ginsberg)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Marx and Nietzsche, Hurka points out, believed that “a central
human good was activity that on the one side is necessarily directed
to a goal but on the other derives its value entirely from aspects
of the process of achieving it.”" (page 274)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"“You have this AI built to do this thing really well,” he added,
“but it doesn’t have any particular experience of it. ... I’m a rock
climber, and AI being able to beat me at Go matters as much as a
helicopter being able to beat me at a rock climb.”" (page 277,
quoting C. Thi Nguyen)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Modern AI systems require gobs of data to train, which makes easily
collectible and cheap data attractive. These easy, quantified
metrics can stand in for success in fields whose aims are in reality
complicated and subtle: clicks for journalism, steps for exercise,
box office for cinema, auction prices for paintings. Nguyen calls
this “value collapse”—when rich, subtle values are replaced by
simplified, quantified versions of those values." (page 278)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Games became solace. We players did not arrive in droves seeking
difficulty or complexity, or a sense of achievement, or a frivolous
distraction. We arrived, I believe, in search of agency that had
been temporarily denied by sensible public health measures." (page
280)</p>
