# Seven Games, by Roeder

[Roeder][] writes about checkers, chess, go, backgammon, poker,
scrabble, and bridge. He gets philosophical, on [Homo ludens][] and
what AI is and so on. It's interesting and I learned about some game
variations that are fun to try. Quality pandemic book.

> "Shannon’s paper described two strategies for programming a computer
> to play chess. Type A programs employed brute-force search and
> evaluation, analyzing every possible move, and all possible
> subsequent moves, no matter how unpromising they might look to a
> human observer. In other words, they exploited the computer’s chief
> strength: sheer calculation. Shannon, however, thought such a player
> would be “both slow and weak.” Type B programs were more selective,
> examining only certain small yet promising branches on chess’s
> enormous tree. In other words, they exploited something like human
> intuition. Early computer scientists thought the successful players
> would be Type B, but with the rapid expansion of computing power,
> computer scientists were lured into pursuing Type A." (page 69)

> "The rules of Go—called weiqi in Chinese, igo in Japanese, and baduk

Compare to ideas of math being discovered vs. invented...

> "Backgammon is one of only two things in life, I heard many times
> during my research, that one never tires of." (page 153)

> "Before bots, everybody believed that they were the best player. The

> the process of improving their own game." (pages 163-164)


---

> "I came to understand that the appeal of this game, like the method

> "The actual lived experience of the World Series of Poker, however,

> tomorrow—between spending and saving." (page 221)

> "Moreover, these languages must be common knowledge. You and your

> opponents, and players are allowed to ask questions of their
> opponents like “What did that bid mean?” Bridge is a game of
> communication but not of subterfuge. As such, the “gravest possible

> information with one’s partner outside of what the rules allow—that
> is, outside of the formal and public bidding process. Illicit
> language is the cardinal sin of the game." (page 247)

> "“I believe that when I say ‘mathematics’ and when Pam or Tim says

> "“You have this AI built to do this thing really well,” he added,

> "Modern AI systems require gobs of data to train, which makes easily
> collectible and cheap data attractive. These easy, quantified
> metrics can stand in for success in fields whose aims are in reality
> complicated and subtle: clicks for journalism, steps for exercise,
> box office for cinema, auction prices for paintings. Nguyen calls
> this “value collapse”—when rich, subtle values are replaced by
> simplified, quantified versions of those values." (page 278)

> "Games became solace. We players did not arrive in droves seeking
