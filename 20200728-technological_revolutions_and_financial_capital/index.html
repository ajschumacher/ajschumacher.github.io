<h1>Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital, by Perez</h1>
<p class="date">Tuesday July 28, 2020</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlota_Perez">Perez</a> offers a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Other_Canon_Foundation" title="The Other Canon">heterodox</a> abduction from economic history, in
the tradition of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Schumpeter">Schumpeter</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kondratiev_wave">Kondratiev</a>, suggesting
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_Revolutions_and_Financial_Capital">Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital</a> dance through
"great surges" of 40 to 60 years, like giant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hype_cycle">hype cycles</a> driving
development.</p>
<p><img alt="hype cycle overlaid with great surge pattern" src="cycle.jpg" /></p>
<p>(The hype cycle analogy isn't perfect; see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_Revolutions_and_Financial_Capital">elsewhere</a> for
summarization of Perez's formulation and five surges.)</p>
<p>Taking Dosi's extension of Kuhn's scientific paradigms to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_paradigm#Giovanni_Dosi">technological paradigms</a> and further involving economics and
societal institutions (especially as capitalism vs. regulation), the
ideas are <a href="https://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/0199251053.001.0001/acprof-9780199251056" title="As Time Goes By, Freeman and Louçã">not wholly original</a>, but neither are they very common.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The justification for an exercise that claims to give order to the
historical record at the expense of its infinite complexity and
richness is its heuristic value." (page 161)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perez doesn't seem happy that the historical approach
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodenstreit" title="Methodenstreit">fell out of favor</a> in economics, and it's neat to see her analysis
cover hundreds of years. This is economic history that doesn't just
refer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods_system">Bretton Woods</a>, but also the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peterloo_Massacre">Peterloo Massacre</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn_Laws">Corn Laws</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabob">nabobs</a>, to sample a few references. You know
about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_68">May 1968 in Europe</a>, right?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The role of the economic historian, as Gay perceived it, was to
study and comprehend these cycles and to suggest ways of restraining
their excesses." (page 158, quoting Cruikshank, extended quote
below)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This book is the closest thing I've seen to Asimov's
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychohistory_(fictional)">psychohistory</a>, as in the <a href="/20200714-foundation_trilogy/">Foundation</a> books. The time-scale
(around 50 years vs. thousands) and claimed predictive power (little
vs. godlike) are very different, but the ideas of anticipating
long-term shifts and being ready for them are analogous, and Perez
does discuss some psychosocial aspects, as in "ethical softening"
during parts of her surges.</p>
<p>The book was published in 2002. It was a theory that fit the dot-com
crash. How has the theory fit since then? The financial industry was
not much reined in, for one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"However, this change in the rules of the game may not be easy,
because the financial collapse has not been spectacular enough to
wipe out the excess self-confidence." (page 168, on the dot-com
crash)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession">Great Recession</a> was just a late example of financial
adventurism. The theory suggests that shouldn't be happening so much
during the deployment phase of the age of information. It's easy to
feel like markets were <em>never</em> really brought back in line with the
real economy. Have we been in a "gilded age"?</p>
<p>It should be about time for the start of a new surge. What will the
next big technology be?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It has often been suggested that biotechnology, bioelectrics and
nanotechnology might conform the next technological revolution."
(page 13)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From where I sit, AI/ML seems like a good candidate. Should we throw
in VR/AR? Blockchain? Private space? Does the social web constitute a
separate technology?</p>
<p>The book's theory treats technologies as available resources just
waiting for capital to fund them into prominence. I think this may be
too much of a simplification. In particular, it's <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/8-lessons-from-20-years-hype-cycles-michael-mullany/">pretty hard</a> to
guess in advance which technologies will take off and which will
fizzle, and I don't think there's any guarantee that there will always
be a technology at hand substantial enough to power another surge.</p>
<p>Alternatively, what if an even longer phase is coming to an end? What
if <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_paradox">declines in productivity growth</a> are a real indication of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function">sigmoid</a> peak of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Transformation_(book)" title="The Great Transformation">Market Society</a> overall, and extended
financial weirdness a sign of an impending larger transformation of
societal system?</p>
<p>It certainly feels, in 2020, as if the world sits on a knife-edge,
with forces pulling in multiple directions. Hopefully history will
help us to create a worthy future.</p>

<p>"... Schumpeter's own view that aggregate figures conceal more than
they reveal." (page 61, refs Schumpeter (1939) Vol. 1, pp. 43-4, I
checked the ref and it's correct, but unfortunately Schumpeter's
language is not very quotable)</p>

<p>"People living through the period of paradigm transition experience
great uncertainty as to the 'right' price of things (including that

clear and simple." (page 67)</p>

<p>"Schumpeter defined capitalism as 'that form of private property
economy in which innovations are carried out by means of borrowed
money'." (page 72, refs Schumpeter (1939) p. 223)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"There is a certain amount of circularity in all these observations,
because the phases have been dated taking the occurrence of crises
into account." (page 79)</p>

values at the beginning of the twenty-first century will only be
appropriately judged with hindsight." (page 112)</p>

<p>Page 146 has an interesting meta-analysis of the field of economics
viewed through the lens of the book's theory.</p>

<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"[E.F. Gay] developed a dynamic vision of economic history [as] a
record of swings of the pendulum between periods when social
controls dominated and periods dominated by the actions of
aggressive individuals. The former periods were static,
characterized by security and stability. The latter periods ushered
in by the introduction of new tools, weapons or other forces, were
controlled by the powerful individuals who introduced these forces.
These dynamic periods ... were crucial to economic development ...
The role of the economic historian, as Gay perceived it, was to
study and comprehend these cycles and to suggest ways of restraining
their excesses." (page 158, quoting Cruikshank, 1987, on the
founding Dean of Harvard Business School)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"The <em>Methodenstreit</em> between the historical school and the
neo-classicals, which in practice expelled the state, Society and
the historical context from economic theory, occurred in the period
of installation of the third surge, which in the periodization
proposed here is parallel to the installation period of the fifth,
when the monetarists defeated the Keynesians." (page 162)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"The ultimate test of usefulness of a model such as the one
presented here is in relation to policy making, be it in business,
in social organizations or in government." (page 163)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Yet if this model is a reasonable approximation to the way the
system works then it is wise to try to engage in the design of
regulations and institutions so they will be ready and in the arena
of debate when the moment comes for them to be accepted." (page 165)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"A golden age of worldwide expansion is possible." (page 171)</p>
