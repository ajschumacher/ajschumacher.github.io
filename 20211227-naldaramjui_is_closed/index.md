Sorry! After over ten years, I've turned off my old site for
practicing [TOPIK][] test questions.

[TOPIK]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_of_Proficiency_in_Korean "Test of Proficiency in Korean"


 * The [official TOPIK site][] is much better than it used to be. It
   has practice questions [every day][]. The interface seems to be
   still largely in Korean even if you switch the language selector at
   the top, but it's not bad! You can find a lot of resources there.
 * The site ran on Google App Engine, using their oldest Python setup.
   It had been pretty stable, but in the last year or so it stopped
   handling cookies right, breaking the answer-evaluating
   functionality, and it didn't seem worth re-working to restore.
 * Some bots were abusing the simple sign-up form to sign up people
   who didn't want to be signed up, which was not cool.
