# The Ministry for the Future, by Robinson

576 [pages][] in 106 chapters. One from POV of the market. Another: a
photon. Writing often in this style. One chapter a list of NGOs by
country. Repeated references to Zürich's [statue][] of Ganymede.
Eco-fantasy from a [lover][] of Antarctica. Largely okay with
terrorism.

Here are some of the core predictions and my thoughts on them:

 * The rich will start caring about poor people affected by climate
   disasters.
     * In the book a heatwave kills 20 million people in India,
       jump-starting a lot of action. Certainly people would take
       note, but I'm not sure even this kind of disaster would
       catalyze global empathy.
 * Eco-terrorism will lead to lots of good changes to behavior and
   policy.
     * People deliberately give cows mad cow disease, so people stop
       eating meat. Lots of planes are crashed by swarms of drones, so
       people stop flying. I think it's unlikely the crimes would be
       committed, and I think if they were it's still unlikely the
       changes would result.
 * Agriculture will all switch to organic and it will go great.
     * The author references [Sikkim][] as an organic success story.
       More recently, it's hard not to think of the failure in
       [Sri Lanka][]. I don't think the world wants to have
       agriculture be more labor-intensive and less productive.
 * Everyone will switch to one privacy-first internet service.
     * In the book it's called "YourLock" and it isn't clear how it
       works. Quantum encryption doesn't make this suddenly something
       people will want to use.
 * Blockchain-based "carbon coin" will encourage carbon sequestration.
     * The book has all fiat currency becoming blockchain-based, and
       also central banks issue these "carbon coins" with guarantees
       on their value increasing over time. The author is really
       jazzed about this but I don't know why it's that much better
       than direct compensation in fiat currency, for example.
 * Modern Monetary Theory is right: You can print money without
   causing inflation.
     * This probably seemed realistic in 2020. In 2022, it seems
       suspect.
 * We're going post-capitalism.
     * The author isn't super clear, in places favoring central
       planning that works (because of AI?) and elsewhere holding up
       [Mondragón][] and unions as exemplars.
 * Guaranteed jobs for all!
     * Is a guaranteed job different from Universal Basic Income?
       (What prevents me from not turning up and just collecting the
       pay? If you can be fired is it a guaranteed job?)
 * 10x max ratio from lowest to highest income.
     * Hmm! Would this be cool?
 * Global refugee passports
     * This seems nice!
 * Airships
     * At least this is sort of a plausible story for why we would use
       airships (to avoid burning carbon). Better story than
       steam-punk.

As a novel, it's not great. As a collection of ideas to think about,
it does introduce a few, but it's not very convincing. It does prompt
some thought. What's really going to happen?


A few quotes follow.

> "Ideology, n. An imaginary relationship to a real situation. In
