<h1>The Myth of the Rational Voter, by Caplan</h1>
<p class="date">Tuesday April  5, 2022</p>
<p>Did anyone ever seriously believe voters were rational? Well,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Caplan">Caplan</a> has a 2007 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Myth_of_the_Rational_Voter">book</a>, and of course the conclusion is that
we should be more libertarian. "Rational" means in agreement with
economists (meaning Caplan), and by page 197 he advocates "a test of
voter competence." As usual, it's not all wrong, but I'm not sure it's
all right.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"[T]he superstitions to be feared in the present day are much less
religious than political; and of all the forms of idolotry I know
none more irrational and ignoble than this blind worship of mere
numbers." (epigraph)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"You should not blame the prescription simply because the patient
refuses to take his medicine. <em>The Myth of the Rational Voter</em>
contains many workable reforms, but due to voter irrationality they
are unlikely to be tried." (ix)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At some point, it is part of the task of solving problems to create
solutions that work in practice, not only in a hypothetical world
imagined by the solver.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Once economists admit to themselves that voters are just like their
students, only worse, they will be poised to unravel the mysteries
of politics and policy." (xi)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The paradox of democracy ... In theory, democracy is a bulwark
against socially harmful policies, but in practice it gives them a
safe harbor." (page 1)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>"Economists and cognitive psychologists usually presume that
everyone "processes information" to the best of his ability." (page
2)</p>
<p>"The main difference between the two disciplines is that cognitive
psychologists are much more likely than economists to conclude that
people's best information processing is not very good." (page 211,
note to preceeding)</p>

<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"This book has three conjoined themes. The first: Doubts about the
rationality of voters are empirically justified. The second: Voter
irrationality is precisely what economic theory implies once we
adopt introspectively plausible assumptions about human motivation.
The third: Voter irrationality is the key to a realistic picture of
democracy." (page 3)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"We also note that <em>no</em> replicated study has made rationality
violations disappear purely by raising incentives." (page 135,
quoting Camerer and Hogarth)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"To get ahead in politics, leaders need a blend of naive populism
and realistic cynicism. No wonder the modal politician has a law
degree." (page 169)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Yet a standard debating tactic of creation scientists is to insist
that "evolutionary theory, along with its bedfellow, secular
humanism, is really a religion."" (page 186; quote is

<p>Is this as bad an idea as the original Laffer Curve?</p>
