# The Myth of the Rational Voter, by Caplan

Did anyone ever seriously believe voters were rational? Well,
[Caplan][] has a 2007 [book][], and of course the conclusion is that
we should be more libertarian. "Rational" means in agreement with
economists (meaning Caplan), and by page 197 he advocates "a test of
voter competence." As usual, it's not all wrong, but I'm not sure it's
all right.

At some point, it is part of the task of solving problems to create
solutions that work in practice, not only in a hypothetical world
imagined by the solver.

Is this as bad an idea as the original Laffer Curve?
