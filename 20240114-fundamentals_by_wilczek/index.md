# Fundamentals: Ten Keys to Reality, by Wilczek

I liked [Wilczek][] on [Dirac][] in [It must be beautiful][], and I
like him a lot [here][]! This is Nobel-prize-winning [QCD][] and also
[time crystal][] guy. Just a beautiful intro to modern particle
physics, scientific perspective, an an optimism for open-ended future
development across all scientific disciplines that reminds me of
[The Beginning of Infinity][].

Of course, consulting physical reality is its own tradition...

I don't know if he has priority, but I'm pretty sure Wilczek's sense
of Radical Conservatism isn't the most common...

I don't think I'd heard quite this explanation before... In light of
"end of science" arguments that big data pushes us more toward
"numbers ... determined purely by fitting the calculations to
observations" this Ptolemaic narrative could almost fit into a kind of
"we were once less wise in our theory, and now we become less wise
again" story.

Wilczek goes on to briefly cover how Kepler's work made the system
still simpler and better-working. Have we simplified everything as
much as it can be? Could we do better?

Finding the right questions, etc. etc.

This reminds me of [Characteristics of good theories][].

Also, this [Pierce][] character came up a bunch in [Larson's book][]
as well. (But this book is much, much better.)

Oh interesting! It seems like [Bennett][] didn't know (or at least
didn't reference) Seneca's [work][] in his How to Live on 24 Hours a
Day.

Locality over reality.

Wilczek identifies "Mass" and "Charge" and "Spin" as the only three
basic, primary properties of matter. (page 73)

It seems like this is related to the [spin–statistics theorem][] or
something? But come on, Wilczek, you big tease...

Democritus was the early atomic theory guy.

I'm not sure that last promise was ever paid off very well...

Is that really a good way to sum up? It reminds me of the
stretched-sheet-of-rubber image, which I think is not so good...

I just thought this was a cool section heading.

On page 190, he uses "rock bottom" to refer to that final point in
explanation beyond which there is no further "why?" I think it's a
good thing to remember, that we can't avoid having such a rock bottom.

This is just the conclusion of a longer section on this topic, which I
like quite a lot. It reminds me of Deutsch's
[Beginning of Infinity](/20220410-beginning_of_infinity_by_deutsch/).

These are the charm, top, strange, and bottom quark, together with the
muon and tauon.
