# Black Holes, by Cox and Forshaw

When I was in elementary school, I found a book about black holes in
the school library. It was wonderful, and it covered approximately the
first chapter of this year's very British [book][] from Cox and
Forshaw. I don't recall [Physics 247][] (2001) having much more than
that either. It's good to see that science has continued!

Hearing about black holes feels like exploring weird edge case
trade-offs in the design of the universe. Quantum mechanics gets
involved, multiplying the disregard for everyday experience. The
[spacetime interval][] and [Penrose diagrams][] increase clarity, and
the Principle of Maximal Ageing is nice. But then we also get
[Black hole complementarity][] (you both fall across the event horizon
_and_ get burned up at the event horizon) and
[the holographic principle][] and [ER = EPR][]. Wild! Keep it up,
science!

The subtitle is "The key to understanding the universe." It's a
compelling hook, and extremes do highlight interesting questions, but
the authors eventually admit that explaining natural phenomena is also
meaningfully distinct from some kinds of understanding, and they
"leave questions of ultimate truth to others" (page 237).

Thought this was funny, but also true?

I feel like they never really came back to this and really pay it off
completely, later in the book...

Is this British grammar? Can I be "down the" other things? "That day
down the library"?

Yes indeed.

But not a really big black hole! Then you get spaghettified well after
crossing the horizon.

Now here is writing that takes bold risks!
