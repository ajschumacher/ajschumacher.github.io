<h1>Black Holes, by Cox and Forshaw</h1>
<p class="date">Thursday June  1, 2023</p>
<p>When I was in elementary school, I found a book about black holes in
the school library. It was wonderful, and it covered approximately the
first chapter of this year's very British <a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/black-holes-brian-coxjeff-forshaw">book</a> from Cox and
Forshaw. I don't recall <a href="https://guide.wisc.edu/courses/physics/">Physics 247</a> (2001) having much more than
that either. It's good to see that science has continued!</p>
<p>Hearing about black holes feels like exploring weird edge case
trade-offs in the design of the universe. Quantum mechanics gets
involved, multiplying the disregard for everyday experience. The
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime#Spacetime_interval">spacetime interval</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_diagram">Penrose diagrams</a> increase clarity, and
the Principle of Maximal Ageing is nice. But then we also get
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole_complementarity">Black hole complementarity</a> (you both fall across the event horizon
<em>and</em> get burned up at the event horizon) and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic_principle">the holographic principle</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ER_%3D_EPR">ER = EPR</a>. Wild! Keep it up,
science!</p>
<p>The subtitle is "The key to understanding the universe." It's a
compelling hook, and extremes do highlight interesting questions, but
the authors eventually admit that explaining natural phenomena is also
meaningfully distinct from some kinds of understanding, and they
"leave questions of ultimate truth to others" (page 237).</p>

<p>A singularity, a moment rather than a place when our knowledge of
the laws of Nature breaks down. According to general relativity, the
singularity lies at the end of time. There is also a singularity in
our past, which marks the beginning of time: the Big Bang. (page 2)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Georges Lemaître, a Catholic priest and one of the founders of
modern cosmology, described the Big Bang singularity at the origin
of our Universe as a day without a yesterday. A singularity formed
by gravitational collapse is a moment with no tomorrow. (page 5)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Sir Roger Penrose’s Nobel Prize-winning <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevLett.14.57">paper</a> ‘Gravitational
Collapse and Space-Time Singularities’, a three-page tour-de-force
in which Penrose proves that, in Wheeler’s words, ‘for just about
any description of matter that anyone has imagined, a singularity
must sit at the centre of a black hole’. (page 16)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>in science, unlike modern-day politics, principles matter. (page 18)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thought this was funny, but also true?</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Space and time may be emergent entities that do not exist in the
deepest description of Nature. Instead, they are synthesised out of
entangled quantum bits of information in a way that resembles a
cleverly constructed computer code. If the Universe is designed, it
seems, the designer is a programmer. (page 20)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I feel like they never really came back to this and really pay it off
completely, later in the book...</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>The Large Hadron Collider at CERN is the world’s most powerful
particle accelerator. The giant machine’s job is to make protons
travel around its underground tunnel at 99.999999 per cent the speed
of light, before smashing them together. The purpose is to explore
the structure of matter and the forces of Nature that animate our
world. The LHC is 27 kilometres in circumference from the point of
view of someone standing on the ground in Geneva, marvelling at this
great engineering achievement. From the point of view of the protons
orbiting around the ring, the circumference is 4 metres. (page 25)</p>

<p>That night down the pub. (page 30)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is this British grammar? Can I be "down the" other things? "That day
down the library"?</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>An entirely reasonable first response to that last paragraph is to
ask what on earth are we talking about. (page 41)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes indeed.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>The point is that, in relativity theory, it is very important to say
exactly how time differences are being determined. Seeing things
(with instruments like eyes) can be very different from measuring
the passage of time using a network of clocks and rulers. The effect
we just discussed is known as the relativistic Doppler effect and it
is sensitive to the location of the light detector (i.e. where the
eyes are). (page 61)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>From the perspective of someone in freefall across the shell at the
Schwarzschild radius the Equivalence Principle informs us that
nothing untoward happens. (page 89)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>for a typical stellar mass black hole you’d be spaghettified before
you even reached the horizon. (page 103)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But not a really big black hole! Then you get spaghettified well after
crossing the horizon.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>In particular, the idea that microscopic wormholes could be part of
the structure of spacetime is part of the ER = EPR hypothesis we’ll
meet in the final chapters. (page 130)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Both the maximally extended Schwarzschild and Kerr solutions are
vacuum solutions to Einstein’s equations–eternal black holes–and as
far as we know, no such black holes exist. (page 141)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Nature is not obliged to make physicists’ lives easier. (page 144)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Noether" title="Emmy Noether">Noether</a> discovered that the law of conservation of energy is a
direct consequence of time translational invariance, which when the
jargon is stripped away means that the result of an experiment does
not depend on what day of the week it is performed (all other things
being equal). Likewise, the law of momentum conservation is a
consequence of translational invariance in space, which means the
result does not depend on where the experiment is performed (all
other things being equal). (page 146)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>David L. Goodstein begins his textbook States of Matter with the
following paragraph: ‘Ludwig Boltzmann, who spent much of his life
studying statistical mechanics, died in 1906, by his own hand. Paul
Ehrenfest, carrying on the work, died similarly in 1933. Now it is
our turn to study Statistical Mechanics.’ (page 172)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now here is writing that takes bold risks!</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>The remainder of the book is about the quest to understand the deep
origins of black hole thermodynamics; a quest that is edging us ever
closer to a new theory of space and time. (page 187)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Hawking’s discovery that black holes emit particles is of profound
importance, not least because it suggests that the origin of the law
of gravity is statistical. (page 190)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>It is now understood that vacuum fluctuations cause the electrons
[in fluorescent lights] to fall back down to the lower energy levels
inside the atom. They ‘tickle’ the atom and trigger the emission of
light. (page 194)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>There is one logical possibility that could explain the results
without resorting to quantum theory: every event in the Universe is
predetermined, freewill does not exist and the results were baked in
at the beginning of time. Putting that aside, we are left with
quantum mechanics. (page 215)</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superdeterminism">Superdeterminism</a>!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the remarkable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reeh%E2%80%93Schlieder_theorem">Reeh–Schlieder theorem</a>, which states that it is
possible to operate on some small region of the vacuum in such a way
that anything can be created anywhere in the Universe. This
phenomenal conjuring trick is theoretically possible because the
vacuum is inexorably entangled. The outlandish nature of the theorem
is diminished ever-so-slightly by the fact that the local operation
required is not something that we could ever perform, which is a
shame. (page 218)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>From the perspective of someone freely falling through the horizon,
they feel nothing and are oblivious to this magical encoding.
Moreover, their fate is to be both spaghettified in the singularity
(from their own perspective) and burnt up on the horizon (from an
outsider’s perspective). But that is no problem for the laws of
Nature because no observer can be present at both events. This is
the essence of the black hole complementarity resolution to the
black hole information paradox. Is it nonsense? (page 226)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>The inside of a black hole, in other words, is somehow ‘the same’ as
the outside. This idea has become known as the holographic
principle. (page 227)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Gravity thus emerges as a result of the quantum mechanics of a
system on the boundary. (page 237)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>We might ask which of these two descriptions is the real one. Is
there really a black hole or is it just a hologram of the boundary
physics? Or maybe the opposite is true, and the boundary physics is
not real and is just a clever way to describe the black hole. Maybe
trying to figure out what is ‘really’ true is to fall into a trap
that has long plagued physicists because it leads to navel gazing
without revealing deeper insight. There are plenty of people in the
world who can perform that function, and too few physicists, so
perhaps we should restrict ourselves to explaining natural phenomena
and leave questions of ultimate truth to others. Rather, the
holographic principle can be viewed as a realisation of
complementarity. There are two equivalent descriptions of the world,
and because they are equivalent there will be no contradictions:
What is true in one will be true in the other. This is the power of
the holographic principle, and Maldacena discovered a precise,
mathematical realisation of it. (page 237)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>The wormhole appears when we allow the two quantum theories to
become entangled. In other words, entanglement builds the wormhole
connecting the two universes together: quantum entanglement and
wormholes go hand in hand. This is a profoundly important connection
between quantum theory and gravity. (page 240)</p>
