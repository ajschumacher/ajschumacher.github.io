<h1>The Art of Doing Science and Engineering, by Hamming</h1>
<p class="date">Saturday July 25, 2020</p>
<p>You should definitely read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hamming">Hamming</a>'s "You and Your Research"
<a href="https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html">talk</a>, and probably also his 1996 <a href="http://worrydream.com/refs/Hamming-TheArtOfDoingScienceAndEngineering.pdf">book</a> (both freely available).
I read the beautiful new printing from <a href="https://press.stripe.com/">Stripe Press</a>, with a
forward by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bret_Victor">Victor</a>. Hamming may not be perfect, but he has a lot of
ideas.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We live in an age of exponential growth in knowledge, and it is
increasingly futile to teach only polished theorems and proofs. We
must abandon the guided tour through the art gallery of mathematics,
and instead teach how to create the mathematics we need. In my
opinion, there is no long-term practical alternative." (page v,
epigraph quoting Hamming)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The book is roughly Hamming's lectures from a graduate course he
taught after he could teach whatever he felt like. It is "Hamming on
Hamming" in that it's largely him expounding on whatever he liked.
It's a bit like a (very technical) grandparent telling stories and
giving advice to their grandkids.</p>
<p><img alt="book cover" src="book_cover.jpg" /></p>
<p>The cover image is a visual form of the book's inspirational message:
A random walk won't take you anywhere, but if you have a vision, a
direction that you keep trying to pursue, then even if not every step
is correct, you will make progress in that direction.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"What is wanted in the long run, of course, is that the man with the
problem does the actual writing of the code with no human interface,
as we all too often have these days, between the person who knows
the problem and the person who knows the programming language. This
date is unfortunately too far off to do much good immediately, but I
would think by the year 2020 it would be fairly universal practice
for the expert in the field of application to do the actual program
preparation rather than have experts in computers (and ignorant of
the field of application) do the program preparation." (page 55;
writing around 1995)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"You read constantly about "engineering the production of software,"
both for the efficiency of production and for the reliability of the
product. But you do not expect novelists to "engineer the production
of novels." The question arises: "Is programming closer to novel
writing than it is to classical engineering?" I suggest yes! Given
the problem of getting a man into outer space, both the Russians and
the Americans did it pretty much the same way, all things
considered, and allowing for some espionage. They were both limited
by the same firm laws of physics. But give two novelists the problem
of writing on "the greatness and misery of man," and you will
probably get two very different novels (without saying just how to
measure this). Give the same complex problem to two modern
programmers and you will, I claim, get two rather different
programs. Hence my belief that current programming practice is
closer to novel writing than it is to engineering. The novelists are
bound only by their imaginations, which is somewhat as the
programmers are when they are writing software. Both activities have
a large creative component, and while you would like to make
programming resemble engineering, it will take a lot of time to get
there—and maybe you really, in the long run, do not want to do it!
Maybe it just sounds good. You will have to think about it many
times in the coming years; you might as well start now and discount
propaganda you hear, as well as all the wishful thinking which goes
on in the area! The software of the utility programs of computers
has been done often enough, and is so limited in scope, so it might
reasonably be expected to become "engineered," but the general
software preparation is not likely to be under "engineering control"
for many, many years.</p>
<p>"There are many proposals on how to improve the productivity of the
individual programmer, as well as groups of programmers. I have
already mentioned top-down and bottom-up; there are others, such as
head programmer, lead programmer, proving the program is correct in
a mathematical sense, and the waterfall model of programming, to
name but a few. While each has some merit I have faith in only one,
which is almost never mentioned—<em>think before you write the
program,</em> it might be called. Before you start, think carefully
about the whole thing, <em>including</em> what will be your acceptance test
that it is right, as well as how later field maintenance will be
done. Getting it right the first time is much better than fixing it
up later!</p>
<p>"One trouble with much of programming is simply that often there is
not a well-defined job to be done; rather, the programming process
itself will gradually discover what the problem is! The desire that
you will be given a well-defined problem before you start
programming often does not match reality, and hence a lot of the
current proposals to "solve the programming problem" will fall to
the ground if adopted rigorously." (pages 57-58)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Many studies have shown programmers differ in productivity, from
worst to best, by much more than a factor of ten. From this I long
ago concluded the best policy is to pay your good programmers very
well but regularly fire the poorer ones—if you can get away with it!
One way is, of course, to hire them on contract rather than as
regularly employed people, but that is increasingly against the law,
which seems to want to guarantee even the worst have some
employment. In practice you may actually be better off to pay the
worst to stay home and not get in the way of the more capable (and I
am serious)!" (page 59)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"I made the comparison of writing software with the act of literary
writing; both seem to depend fundamentally on clear thinking. Can
good programming be taught? If we look at the corresponding teaching
of "creative writing" courses we find most students of such courses
do not become great writers, and most great writers in the past did
not take creative writing courses! Hence it is dubious that great
programmers can be trained easily.</p>
<p>"Does experience help? Do bureaucrats after years of writing reports
and instructions get better? I have no real data, but I suspect with
time they get worse! The habitual use of "governmentese" over the
years probably seeps into their writing style and makes them worse.
I suspect the same for programmers! Neither years of experience nor
the number of languages used is any reason for thinking the
programmer is getting better from these experiences. An examination
of books on programming suggests most of the authors are not good
programmers!</p>
<p>"The results I picture are not nice, but all you have to oppose it
is wishful thinking—I have evidence of years and years of
programming on my side!" (pages 60-61)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"People often make the mistake of saying, "Thinking is what Newton
and Einstein did." But by that definition most of us cannot
think—and usually we do not like that conclusion!" (page 79)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"... Of course robots will displace many humans doing routine jobs.
In a very real sense, machines can best do routine jobs, thus
freeing humans for more humane jobs. Unfortunately, many humans at
present are not equipped to compete with machines—they are unable to
do much more than routine jobs. There is a widespread belief (hope?)
that humans can compete, once they are given proper training.
However, I have long publicly doubted you could take many coal
miners and make them into useful programmers. I have my reservations
on the fraction of the human population that can be made into
programmers in the classical sense; if you call getting money from
the bank dispensing "machine programming," or the dialing of a
telephone number (both of which apply the human input to an
elaborate program which is then executed, much like an interpreter
acts on your program input), then of course most people can be made
into programmers. But if you mean the more classical activity of
careful analysis of a situation and then the detailed specification
as to what is to be done, then I say there are doubts as to what
fraction of the population can <em>compete</em> with computers, even with
nice interactive prompting menus.</p>
<p>"Computers have both displaced so many people from jobs, and also
made so many new jobs, it is hopeless to try to answer which is the
larger number. But it is clear that on average it is the lower-level
jobs which are disappearing and the higher-level jobs which are
appearing. Again, one would like to believe <em>most</em> people can be
trained in the future to do the higher-level jobs—but that is a hope
without any real evidence." (pag 94)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"We started to play games on computers to study the human thought
processes and not to win the game; the goal has been perverted to
win, and never mind the insight into the human mind and how it
works." (page 100)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Thus AI requires your careful thought and should not be dismissed
lightly just because many experts make obviously false claims."
(page 103)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>Information theory</em> was created by C.E. Shannon in the late 1940s.
The management of Bell Telephone Labs wanted him to call it
"communication theory," as that is a far more accurate name, but for
obvious publicity reasons "information theory" has a much greater
impact—this Shannon chose and so it is known to this day." (page
163)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"It is always wise to adopt a standard notation and framework of
thinking of diverse things—one field of application may suggest
things to do in the other. I have found it of great value to do so
whenever possible—remove the extraneous scale factors and get to the
basic expressions. (But then I was originally trained as a
mathematician.)" (page 184)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"It is another example of why you need to know the fundamentals very
well; the fancy parts then follow easily and you can do things that
they never told you about." (page 186)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Many people had the opportunity to discover (really rediscover) the
Gibbs phenomenon, and it was Gibbs who made the effort. It is
another example of what I maintain, that there are opportunities all
around and few people reach for them. As Pasteur said, "Luck favors
the prepared mind."" (page 201)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"It must be your friends, in some sense, who make you famous by
quoting and citing you, and it pays, so I claim, to be helpful to
others as they try to do their work. They may in time give you
credit for the work, which is better than trying to claim it
yourself. Cooperation is essential in these days of complex
projects; the day of the individual worker is dying fast. Teamwork
is more and more essential, and hence learning to work on a team,
indeed possibly seeking out places where you can help others, is a
good idea. In any case the fun of working with good people on
important problems is more pleasure than the resulting fame." (page
210)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Moral: when you know something cannot be done, also remember the
essential reason why, so later, when the circumstances have changed,
you will not say, "It can't be done."" (page 218, on how he missed
the opportunity to help develop FFT)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Let us analyze carefully what we do and its implications, because
<em>what we do to a great extent controls what we can see.</em>" (page 219)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"If you will only ask yourself, "Is what I am being told really
true?," it is amazing how much you can find is, or borders on, being
false, even in a well-developed field!" (page 227)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"When I went to Bell Telephone Laboratories in 1946 I soon found
myself in the early stages of the design of the earliest Nike system
of guided missiles." (page 238)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"I have emphasized the necessity of having the underlying laws of
whatever field you are simulating well under control. But there are
no such laws of economics! The only law of economics that I believe
in is Hamming's law: "You cannot consume what is not produced."
There is not another single reliable law in all of economics I know
of which is not either a tautology in mathematics or else sometimes
false. Hence when you do simulations in economics you have not the
reliability you have in the hard sciences." (page 250)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Now this fact, once understood, impacts design! Good design
protects you from the need for too many highly accurate components
in the system. But such design principles are still, to this date,
ill understood and need to be researched extensively. Not that good
designers do not understand this intuitively, merely it is not
easily incorporated into the design methods you were taught in
school. Good minds are still needed in spite of all the computing
tools we have developed. But the best mind will be the one who gets
the principle into the design methods taught so it will be
automatically available for lesser minds!" (page 269)</p>

<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"You also realize any dictionary must be circular; the first word
you look up must be defined in terms of other words—there can be no
first definition which does not use words." (page 307)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"When stuck I often ask myself, "If I had a solution, what would it
look like?" This tends to sharpen up the approach, and may reveal
new ways of looking at the problem you had subconsciously ignored
but now see should not be excluded. What must the solution involve?
Are there conservation laws which must apply? Is there some
symmetry? How does each assumption enter into the solution, and is
each one really necessary? Have you recognized all the relevant
factors?" (page 327)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"...saturate the subconscious with the problem, try to not think
seriously about anything else for hours days, or even weeks, and
thus the subconscious ... is left with only the problem to mull
over. We simply deprive it of all else as best we can! ... In a way,
I am repeating Pasteur, "Luck favors the prepared mind." You prepare
your mind for success "by thinking on it constantly" (Newton), and
occasionally you are lucky." (page 328)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Probably the most important tool in creativity is the use of an
<em>analogy.</em> Something seems like something else which we knew in the
past. Wide acquaintance with various fields of knowledge is thus a
help—<em>provided</em> you have the knowledge filed away so it is available
when needed, rather than to be found only when led directly to it.
This flexible access to pieces of knowledge seems to come from
looking at knowledge <em>while you are acquiring it</em> from many
different angles, turning over any new idea to see its many sides
before filing it away. This implies effort on your part not to take
the easy, immediately useful "memorizing the material" path, but to
prepare your mind for the future. It is for this reason I have urged
you in many of the chapters to get down to the fundamentals of a
field, since it implies you must examine things in many ways before
you can decide what is fundamental and what is frills. In fact, for
one person they may be in one order, and for another in the opposite
order. What is fundamental partly depends on the individual and
their mental makeup. It is obvious you need many "hooks" on the
knowledge if you are to use it in new situations.</p>
<p>"... I can only advise you to do what I do—when you learn something
new, think of other applications of it, ones which have not arisen
in your past but which might in your future. How easy to say, but
how hard to do! Yet what else can I say about how to organize your
mind so useful things will be recalled readily at the right time?"
(pages 328-329)</p>

<p>"The person who thinks they understand the problem and does not is
usually more of a curse (blockage) than the person who knows they do
not understand the problem." (page 333)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"It has been my experience, as well as the experience of many others
who have looked, that data is generally much less accurate than it
is advertised to be." (page 345)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"From that experience I learned never to process any data until I
had first examined it carefully for errors. There have been
complaints that I would take too long, but almost always I found
errors, and when I showed the errors to them they had to admit I was
wise in taking the precautions I did. No matter how sacred the data
and urgent the answer, I have learned to pretest it for consistency
and outliers at a minimum." (page 348)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Second, you cannot gather a really large amount of data accurately.
It is a known fact which is constantly ignored. It is always a
matter of limited resources and limited time. The management will
usually want a 100% survey when a small one consisting of a good
deal less, say 1% or even 0.1%, will yield more accurate results! It
is known, I say, but ignored. The telephone companies, in order to
distribute the income to the various companies involved in a single
long-distance phone call, used to take a very small, carefully
selected sample, and on the basis of this sample they distributed
the money among the partners. The same is now done by the airlines.
It took them a long while before they listened, but they finally
came to realize the truth that <em>small samples carefully taken are
better than large samples poorly done</em>—better both in lower cost and
in greater accuracy." (page 355)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Of the things you can choose to measure some are hard, firm
measurements, such as height and weight, while some are soft, such
as social attitudes. There is always a tendency to grab the hard,
firm measurement, though it may be quite irrelevant as compared to
the soft one, which in the long run may be much more relevant to
your goals. <em>Accuracy</em> of measurement tends to get confused with
<em>relevance</em> of measurement, much more than most people believe. That
a measurement is accurate, reproducible, and easy to make does not
mean it should be done; instead, a much poorer one which is more
closely related to your goals may be much preferable. For example,
in school it is easy to measure training and hard to measure
education, and hence you tend to see on final exams an emphasis on
the training part and a great neglect of the education part.</p>
<p>"Let me turn to another effect of a measurement system, and
illustrate it by the definition and use of IQs. What is done is a
plausible list of questions—plausible from past experience—is made
and then tried out on a small number of people. Those questions
which show an internal correlation with others are kept and those
which do not correlate well are dropped. Next, the revised test is
calibrated by using it on a much larger sample. How? Simply by
taking the accumulated scores (the number of people's score which
are below the given amount) and plotting these revised numbers on
probability paper—meaning the cumulative probabilities of a normal
distribution are the horizontal lines. Next, the points where the
cumulative actual scores fall at a given percentage points are
related, via a calibration table, to the corresponding points on the
cumulative normal probability curve. As a result it is observed
intelligence has a normal distribution in the population! Of course
it has, it was made to be that way! Furthermore, they have defined
intelligence to be what is measured by the calibrated exam, and if
that is the definition of intelligence, then of course intelligence
is normally distributed. But if you think maybe intelligence is not
exactly what the calibrated exam measures, then you are entitled to
doubt intelligence is normally distributed in the population. Again,
you get what was measured, and the normal distribution announced is
an artifact of the method of measurement and hardly relates to
reality." (pages 374-375)</p>
