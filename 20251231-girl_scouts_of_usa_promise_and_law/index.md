# Girl Scouts of the USA Promise and Law


### Girl Scout Promise

On my honor, I will try:<br />
To serve God* and my country,<br />
To help people at all times,<br />
And to live by the Girl Scout Law.

*Members may substitute for the word God<br />
in accordance with their own spiritual beliefs.


### Girl Scout Law

I will do my best to be<br />
honest and fair,<br />
friendly and helpful,<br />
considerate and caring,<br />
courageous and strong,<br />
and responsible for what I say and do,<br />
and to respect myself and others,<br />
respect authority,<br />
use resources wisely,<br />
make the world a better place,<br />
and be a sister to every Girl Scout.

the Girl Scouts of the USA. (Equivalents elsewhere are often called
"Girl Guides.")

The explicit flexibility for different spiritualities is not unique to
Girl Scouts of the USA. For example, UK Scouts publishes eight
versions of each of its [promises][] covering Atheists, Buddhists,
Christians, Hindus, Humanists, Jews, Muslims, and Sikhs.

Juliette Gordon Low’s [original][] Promise and Law from 1912 was very
similar to Baden-Powell’s. It included, for example, that "a Girl
Scout keeps herself pure," instead of that "a Scout is clean in
thought, word and deed."
