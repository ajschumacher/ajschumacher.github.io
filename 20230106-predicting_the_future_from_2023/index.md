# Predicting the future from 2023

I've tried to predict the future the last three years: [2020][],
[2021][], [2022][]. I think that's probably enough for now. Here are
some 2023 [predictions from Vox][], if you want.

If you make new predictions every year, you end up with a lot of them.
I managed to have at least one set of _conflicting_ predictions in
just three years.

The big trends don't change that much year to year, and I've already
thought about those some. Many of them are clear enough that even a
large language model knows them.

This year there is a swing toward economic recession... Will it end?
Almost certainly yes, but it's a little scary.
