# Echopraxia, by Watts


Here's Watts' follow-up to [Blindsight][]. Blindsight is about
consciousness, and Echopraxia largely is too, but it may have been
intended to also be about free will (except Watts didn't find it that
interesting) and ends up largely more of the same cosmic horror,
ret-conning the narrator from Blindsight into the new alien invasion
story. It's more fun apocalipsia.

[Digital physics][] (though I prefer the name "Information Mechanics")
is kind of a fun idea. The Wikipedia page is weak; it doesn't even
mention [Kantor][].

"Burgeoning" is a stretch, I think. (This bit is from the
non-fictional author's statement at the end.)

There's lots on "enhanced" humans, and Watts cites
[Poll results: look who's doping][] from Nature, which suggested in
2008 that around 20% of scientists take Ritalin or something like it.

There's some strange religiosity, and Watts cites an article about de
Botton's [Religion for Atheists][].
