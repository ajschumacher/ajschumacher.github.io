<h1>Communicate Immediately</h1>

<p>Discover what's important and present it early and concisely to refine
your ideas and engage with your audience. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_pyramid_(journalism)">Don't bury the lede</a>. Put

<h3><a name="message"></a>Identify your message</h3>
<p>What your audience needs most is your unique contribution: a result or
recommendation, a summary or synthesis. Help them to understand.
Prepare them to take action.</p>
<p>If you don't know what your message is, you have little chance of
communicating it. Think beyond listing what you've done, what you've
read, what you've seen. Find a deeper conclusion. Even without an
audience, you should be doing this for yourself.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Mathematical_Theory_of_Communication">Shannon</a>, information is related to surprise. One
heuristic is to identify the most central "surprise" you have to
communicate. What does your audience not know? Can you anticipate
questions they would ask, and answer them?</p>
<p>Don't force your audience to come to their own conclusions. Your
message won't prevent them from doing that anyway, if you are honest
and <a href="#detail">complete</a>. Your message isn't the final word. It should
be a generous starting point.</p>
<p>Regardless of audience, the practice of articulating a message into
short concrete forms can help you to clarify and improve your ideas,
possibly through several iterations.</p>
<h3><a name="line"></a>Give a one-line version</h3>
<p>Start with a title, or subject line, or initial answer to a question.
A one-line version should be complete enough that the audience can
choose whether to continue.</p>
<p>Good newspaper headlines, like "Truman wins presidency," are tiny
versions of their articles. Clickbait titles illustrate what not to
do, as in "You won't believe what Truman did." Emulate good headlines.</p>
<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dewey_Defeats_Truman -->

<p>Good one-line versions are usually complete sentences, not just noun
phrases. Don't convey just the subject you're talking about, include
what you're saying about it.</p>
<p>Feel free to use the specialized language of your field.
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10029v1">Big Self-Supervised Models are Strong Semi-Supervised Learners</a> is
a great title for a Machine Learning paper, though it may seem opaque
to botanists.</p>
<p>Though the need for summarizing is real, there's value in retaining
important detail. For example, "Technique X Improves Results" is
likely not a better one-line version than "Technique X Improves Metric
Y by 3%." Include specifics as much as you can.</p>
<p>It may be challenging to distill your message into a faithful one-line
representation, but it can be done. In some cases, a one-line version
is all you need.</p>
<h3><a name="paragraph"></a>Give a one-paragraph version</h3>
<p>Whether it's labeled as an abstract or a summary or not, a first
paragraph should always be a complete version of your message, not an
introduction.</p>
<p>The one-line version of your message may be just a sketch, but a
well-crafted paragraph lets you convey, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">Pareto</a>-style, a complete
core message, missing only detail.</p>
<p>The practice of skipping quickly to an article's conclusion is not a
natural part of reading, it is a defensive work-around for bad
writing. Present the conclusion at the beginning.</p>
<p>You shouldn't require your audience go all the way to the end. For
example, if the purpose of an email is to make a request, make the
request clear at the beginning.</p>
<p>The focus here is effective, purposeful, reality-oriented
communication. This is distinct from small talk, poetry, or fiction,
where it may make sense to approach a topic obliquely over time, to
carefully build an effect.</p>
<p>With a useful one-paragraph version at the beginning, the audience can
determine what information is being communicated and what further
detail they're interested in. This is kind to your audience—and your
audience may be you.</p>
<h3><a name="detail"></a>Add detail until complete</h3>
<p>Including condensed versions at the beginning doesn't mean omitting
supporting detail, clarification, data, and other supplementary
material. Be very inclusive. The expectation is not that the audience
must review everything, but that they may.</p>
<p>Organize for the benefit of the audience. Make it easy to find things.
This should follow from the nature of what you're communicating, and
could also be responsive to the expectations of your audience.</p>
<p>The overall structure should often be fractal, in that further
sections are organized following the overall guidelines, starting with
short versions.</p>
<p>Generally, information density and polish should decrease gradually.
Content at the beginning is likely still elaborating the core message.
More related detail is added gradually, until toward the end one might
include a list of references, notes, logs of activities over time,
source data, audio or transcriptions from interviews, and the like.</p>
<p>Enough should be provided that the audience can replicate your
conclusions or form their own. Nothing should be hidden.</p>
<h3><a name="media"></a>Use the best of text and other media</h3>
<p>Text is a mighty tool, but it is not the only tool. Always use the
best available tool for communicating. Outside of conversation, text
and its variants together with two-dimensional graphics (especially
data visualizations) are most useful, with time-distributed media and
interactive artifacts only sometimes worthwhile.</p>
<p>Text can be used in many ways. Headings add structure. Numbered and
bulleted lists and tables can help organize and summarize. Fonts,
weights, sizes, and styles can assist in communication when used well.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext">Hypertext</a> allows linking easily to related resources.</p>
<p>Numbers are data visualizations, as are quantitative tables. Carefully
presented numbers can be very communicative.</p>
<p>Graphics can help communicate ideas diagrammatically. Graphical data
visualizations (plots, graphs, charts) can convey quantitative
information exceptionally well; their effective use is an extended
topic. Images can also sometimes be useful.</p>
<p>Time-distributed media refers principally to audio and video. To date,
these are difficult to search or skim. They tend to require the
audience to sit through them. Similarly, interactive artifacts are
relatively oblique rather than communicating directly. There are
places for all of these, but they are not often the best choice for
direct communication.</p>    </article>
