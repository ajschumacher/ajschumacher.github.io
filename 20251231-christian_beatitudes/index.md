# Christian Beatitudes

 * Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of
   heaven.
 * Blessed are they who mourn, for they will be comforted.
 * Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the land.
 * Blessed are they who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they
   will be satisfied.
 * Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.
 * Blessed are the clean of heart, for they will see God.
 * Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of
   God.
 * Blessed are they who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness,
   for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.


These eight verses are Matthew 5:3-10 in the NABRE (New American Bible
Revised Edition) translation used in Catholic churches in the US, and
the most famous part of the Sermon on the Mount delivered by Jesus.

"Beatitude" is from a word meaning "blessed" and not any breakdown
like "be" followed by "attitude." Interpretations vary, with at least
[one][] being that the Beatitudes are not just reports about who is
blessed but a step-by-step guide to becoming more blessed.
