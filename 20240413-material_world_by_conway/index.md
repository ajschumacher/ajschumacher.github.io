# (Audio) Material World, by Conway

[Conway][] offers glimpses into a material world of sand, salt, iron,
copper, oil, and lithium for inhabitants of the aetherial world of
knowledge, software, and office blocks. It's often fascinating, and
delivers a thesis of global interconnection: we all depend on
everyone.

The [Chloralkali process][] is electrolysis of very salty water. It
produces chlroine gas, which will kill you, and sodium hydroxide aka
lye, which isn't healthy either and which you can use to pulp wood and
make paper. This is very cool, and something you could probably do at
home. It's a little dangerous. I wonder if this is part of how we lose
education about the material world, by avoiding parts that are both
interesting and risky.

Maybe it's just my perspective as a computer guy, but I feel like the
work of the physical world is too often ignored and undervalued.
Something like Hammerbacher has said, it feels like everyone wants to
get rich at a keyboard while the lab benches are empty.


The book in a couple places recommends going to YouTube to see a
video, with search terms to use. I feel like I've heard this kind of
thing in a few books recently. Is this what books do now? They can't
embed video, so they tell you to go find the video yourself on
YouTube? I'm not 100% opposed, but this feels a little gross to me.
