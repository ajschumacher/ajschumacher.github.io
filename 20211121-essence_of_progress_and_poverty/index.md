# The Essence of Progress and Poverty, by Henry George

This is a 2020 version of the 1928 abridging (endorsed by
[John Dewey][]) of the 1879 original. It's enough to
[“see the cat”][], I think, but I'm not yet convinced [Georgism][] is
[“how the world could be made a good and happy place”][]. The single
tax on land seems like a decent idea, but I'm not sure it's sufficient
for Star Trek style post-scarcity utopia ([a][], [b][]).

It's nice to encounter an idea that's _trying_ to be a big solution. I
don't know a good reason not to try it, apart from that those who are
currently own land wouldn't like it.

Couple things.

 * "Anglo-Saxon vigor"? How deep is this racist-imperialist thinking?
   Does he think only white people are people?
 * Was this ever true, that net migration was from richer to poorer
   countries? Is it true now? Certainly the stereotype is that people
   prefer to move from poorer to richer countries "in search of higher
   wages".
 * Is it really true that the situation he describes is somehow a cure
   for poverty, or is it that George is wrong, or perhaps that people
   who would be poor cannot survive in such settings, so they aren't
   observed, or some combination?

This makes me think of antagonism toward "elites"... Not a perfect
connection though.

But it also isn't that employers keep throwing more money at
employees, and then landlords respond by increasing rents. If rent was
suddenly free, wouldn't employers lower wages in response to the
changed cost of living? Currently we see employers adjusting salaries
of remote employees based on cost of living in various markets, which
is largely driven by cost of housing.

This is tautological or incorrect.
