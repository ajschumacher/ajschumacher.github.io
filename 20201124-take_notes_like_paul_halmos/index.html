<h1>Take notes like Paul Halmos</h1>
<p class="date">Tuesday November 24, 2020</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Halmos">Paul Halmos</a> recommended taking minimalist notes and then later
expanding the notes from memory. This lets you pay more attention in
the moment and then exercise your recall afterward, which is good for
memory. Paired with speech-to-text transcription, you can also avoid
the risk of missing anything.</p>
<p>Here's how Halmos explained note-taking in his automathography:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Lecture courses are a standard way of learning something–one of the
worst ways. Too passive, that's the trouble. Standard
recommendation: take notes. Counter argument: yes, to be sure,
taking notes is an activity, and if you do it, you have something
solid to refer back to afterward, but you are likely to miss the
delicate details of the presentation as well as the big picture, the
Gestalt–you are too busy scribbling to pay attention. Counter
counter-argument: if you don't take notes, you won't remember what
happened, in what order it came, and, chances are, your attention
will flag part of the time, you'll daydream, and, who knows, you
might even nod off.</p>
<p>"It's all true, the arguments both for and against taking notes. My
own solution is a compromise: I take very skimpy notes, and then,
whenever possible, I transcribe them, in much greater detail, as
soon afterward as possible. By very skimpy notes I mean something
like one or two words a minute, plus, possibly a crucial formula or
two and a crucial picture or two–just enough to fix the order of
events, and, incidentally, to keep me awake and on my toes. By
transcribe I mean in enough detail to show a friend who wasn't
there, with some hope that he'll understand what he missed." (Paul
Halmos, "I want to be a mathematician")</p>
