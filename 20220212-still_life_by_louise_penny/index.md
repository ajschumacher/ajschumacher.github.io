# Still Life, by Louise Penny

Put on your Sony ‘Discman’ and grab your palm pilot, because it's
[Louise Penny][]'s first book featuring
[Chief Inspector Armand Gamache][] (read "Galonche") from 2006!

> ‘Life is change. If you aren’t growing and evolving you’re standing

> people are very immature. They lead “still” lives, waiting.’ (Myrna,
> page 140)


I would be very pleased if I wrote a book as good as this. It's
charming fun with a bit of morality play blended in.


> ‘We choose our thoughts. We choose our perceptions. We choose our
> attitudes. We may not think so. We may not believe it, but we do. I
> absolutely know we do. I’ve seen enough evidence, time after time,
> tragedy after tragedy. Triumph after triumph. It’s about choice.’
> (Gamache, page 80)


Stoic? Positive psychology? Right wing?

There's little sympathy for men's-rights-style whining:


> "We’re not respected just by virtue of being English. It’s not the
> same thing. Do you have any idea how much our lives have changed in
> the last twenty years? All the rights we’ve lost?" (Ben Hadley, page
> 50)


I enjoyed the art world dalliance, which reminded me somewhat of the
end of Vonnegut's Bluebeard. And Nichol! Who's never been Nichol? So
awful! So fun to hate, and/or pity.


I collected things of varying degrees of Canadianness that I looked
up. (Do compound bows have built-in triggers in Montreal?)


 * as hard as the [Canadian Shield][]: a large area of exposed
   Precambrian rock
 * [beaver stick][]: just what it sounds like
 * [Canadiens][]: the Montreal hockey team
 * cured Canadian bacon: but they mean regular bacon
 * _dépanneur_: A convenience store, especially one that sells
   alcohol (in Quebec)
 * [Eaton's catalogue][]: one of the first mail-order catalogs
   distributed by a Canadian retail store
 * He’s a Golden Mile boy: refers to a rich [area][] of Montreal
 * Inspector Clouseau: The Chief Inspector from The Pink Panther
 * Inuk island: apparently Inuk is interchangeable with Inuit? Is this
   a specific place?
 * "Lee Valley catalogue": "Lee Valley Tools Ltd. is a Canadian
   business specializing in tools and gifts for woodworking and
   gardening."
 * Lune Moon: a funny Canadian [snack cake][]
 * ‘May I have his co-ordinates, please?’ (page 61) was asking for a
   person's location. Is this a common phrasing?
 * Méteo Media: "a Canadian French-language weather information
   specialty channel and web site"
 * tabarouette, tabarnouche: "Mild version of french-canadian curse
   word tabarnak."
 * Tabernacle: This is a curse, somehow?
 * tête carrée: "square head" / blockhead
 * three extra large ‘All Dressed’ from Pizza Pizza: "Montreal
   [slang][] for the works"

 * toques: normal winter hats, but in Canada (read "tooks")
 * to twig: To realise something; to catch on; to recognize someone or
   something (British?)
 * village cozy: A [mystery genre][] referenced by a character. Still
   Life is pretty close to a village cozy.
 * ‘yes yes’ cookies: Apparently these are like the Girl Scouts'
   "Samoas"
