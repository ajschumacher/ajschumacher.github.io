# Understanding bipolar disorder, by Daramus

This 2020 [book][] is short (149 pages) and kind. With a therapist's
tact, it advises stoic behavior (see also: [The Enchiridion][]) and
introduces helpful concepts and terminology (like on page 107,
"euthymic" means "not having a mood episode right now"). It seems like
pretty good guidance for a difficult condition.
