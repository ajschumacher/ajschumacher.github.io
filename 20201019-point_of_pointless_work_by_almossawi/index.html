<h1>The Point of Pointless Work, by Almossawi</h1>
<p class="date">Monday October 19, 2020</p>
<p>The title's not quite right, but there's some on that. <a href="https://almossawi.com/pointless-work/">It</a>'s mostly
Almossawi's personal adventures in publishing: the stories of
<a href="/20201012-bad_arguments_by_almossawi/">Bad Arguments</a> and <a href="/20201011-bad_choices_by_almossawi/">Bad Choices</a>. I enjoyed it.</p>
<p>I liked the detail about publishing, including buying a pack of ten
ISBNs, and agonizing about getting pallets of books from a ship and
into Amazon fulfillment centers.</p>
<p>I also think he's right that it's good for people to do things not
just out of economic necessity, and we're fortunate when we're able to
do so.</p>

<h3>Selected quotes and commentary</h3>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Anatol Rapoport has excellent advice about how to criticize. A
critic, he says, ought to begin by stating the other side's position
in a fair and objective way, then mentioning the areas of agreement,
and only then mentioning the areas of disagreement. The approach
does wonders when the goal is to turn something into a better
version of itself rather than to posture." (page 42)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I also found more on this in a <a href="http://www.rightattitudes.com/2017/06/16/rapoport-rules-criticism/">post</a> based on a book by Dennett
which is in my to-read pile.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"I was surprised to find that the copyeditors were all freelancers.
... When [prior employee copyeditors] retired, the publisher
determined that it made economic and organizational sense to
outsource that responsibility to freelancers." (page 74)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet another example of trying to get work done by contractors rather
than employees.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"... Abraham Flexner's essay from almost a century ago on useless
knowledge." (page 100)</p>
</blockquote>
