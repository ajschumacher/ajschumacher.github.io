<h1>Story-time with Aaron: Part 8</h1>
<p class="date">Wednesday September  1, 2010</p>
<p>(<a href="/2010/09/01/story-time-with-aaron-part-7/">Part 7</a>)<br><br>---<br><br>"Do you ever wonder about time?"<br><br>Aaron is eating a bowl of something like it did something to him. "What?"<br><br>"Time. You know; time is weird."<br><br>"You know what's weird? You're weird. Shut up." Maybe that bowl of something really did do something to him.<br><br>"No, come on... You know, they say time is a dimension just like up and  down. I can jump up and down, but I can't do anything like that with  time."<br><br>Aaron is working hard to dig out the bottom of that blue bowl. "Yeah,  that Einstein Einstein said a lot of crazy shit. You know he thought  everybody was going to be vegetarian?"<br><br>"What? Look, I'm just saying, what if it stopped?"<br><br>"What if what stopped?" Aaron is deliberately looking at something he is not interested in."<br><br>"Time! I mean, what if time just stopped for a while? Would we even know? Could we?"<br><br>"What would it mean for time to stop?" Either Aaron's mood is getting  better and he's joining the conversation, or he's just asking a banal  question to avoid entering the conversation.<br><br>"You know, time is always going, right? It seems like it's always going. Always the same speed. So what if right now<br><br>time stopped and then it started again?"<br><br>Aaron is watching a TV that isn't there. "How long did it stop for? Stupid."<br><br>"That's what I mean though - I guess to know something stopped, it has  to be in the same place for some length of time. But maybe it's like,  somebody else's time."<br><br>Aaron looks up. "Like, God's time?"<br><br>"Yeah, something like that, right?"<br><br>"I don't believe in god." Aaron looks down again.<br><br>"But just imagine, you know, something like god. Just something outside that still feels time passing."<br><br>Aaron is changing channels on the imaginary TV. "Weren't we going to nuke Jerusalem? What ever happened with that?"<br><br>"Are you fucking serious?"<br><br>Aaron is unphased. "That wouldn't be time stopping. It would be more  like our consciousness jumping over some span where your god is still  waiting around. And I guess everything is sort of frozen, except god is  thinking there, really really bored."<br><br>"What if it was like, another direction of time?"<br><br>"So god is really bored like eternally at every moment in our time  stream. Doesn't sound much better for god." Aaron doesn't seem to mind  that it's an infomercial.<br><br>"Nobody signs up to be god."<br><br>Aaron's chair looks more comfortable all of a sudden. "So, in conclusion, time goes on, and it sucks to be god?"<br><br>"You know, sometimes I wonder why I even talk to you."<br><br>"What about Jerusalem then? We could help god out." Aaron smiles.</p>
