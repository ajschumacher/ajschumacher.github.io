<h1>Pity the Reader, by McConnell</h1>
<p class="date">Tuesday March  7, 2023</p>
<p>Vonnegut is the headline, and there are a lot of quotes, but it's
McConnell's book: elegy, eulogy, paean. I was down on the man a little
after I read about his affair in a biography years ago, but this
reminded me of his quality.</p>
<p>Vonnegut was an activist author, which I think is good. He was also an
entertainer and technician. Too much writing might as well come from
ChatGPT: predictable word after word. "Don’t be predictable. End your
sentences with something unexpected. Keep me awake." (page 195) A good
sentence delights you with pleasant thrills like a fresh ski run. On
writing with style: keep the entropy low.</p>
<p><img alt="cover" src="cover.jpg" /></p>
<p>In the following quotes, I make no attempt to clarify whether they
come from Vonnegut or McConnell or a character etc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"fiction is melody, and journalism, new or old, is noise." (page 44)</p>
<p>"Vonnegut earned no degree in anthropology." (page 52)</p>
<p>"Commitment invites Fate to be your Fairy Godmother Collaborator, to
close and open just the doors you need." (page 76)</p>
<p>"I once read an interview with John Barth and Kurt Vonnegut and
others in which Vonnegut stated that the reason all writers write,
of course, is that they want to change the world. Whereupon Barth
objected. No, he said. That wasn’t why he wrote. As I recall, Barth
said, in effect, that he just liked to horse around with words."
(page 84)</p>
<p>"Our awareness is all that is alive and maybe sacred in any of us."
(page 93)</p>
<p>"Writing is a generosity, even to yourself." (page 94)</p>
<p>"Vonnegut considered Galápagos his best book, by the way. Because
his canary-in-the-coal-mine is on urgent tweet." (page 119)</p>
<p>"Writers who are swoopers, it seems to me, find it wonderful that
people are funny or tragic or whatever, worth reporting, without
wondering why or how people are alive in the first place. Bashers,
while ostensibly making sentence after sentence as efficient as
possible, may actually be breaking down seeming doors and fences,
cutting their ways through seeming barbed-wire entanglements, under
fire and in an atmosphere of mustard gas, in search of answers to
these eternal questions: “What in heck should we be doing? What in
heck is really going on?”" (page 171)</p>
<p>"The young man did not appear to be listening to his own radio. He
may not even have understood English. The newscaster spoke with a
barking sort of hilarity, as though life were a comical
steeplechase, with unconventional steeds and hazards and vehicles
involved. He made me feel that even I was a contestant—in a bathtub
drawn by three aardvarks, perhaps. I had as good a chance as anybody
to win." (page 176)</p>
<p>"You have to play by the rules of the game of fiction well enough so
that you can get across what is in the rag-and-bone shop of your
heart. You have to be like a magician or pickpocket, distracting the
audience by entertaining, while you are really saying those things
you most want to say." (page 189)</p>
<p>"I don’t praise plots as accurate representations of life, but as
ways to keep readers reading." (page 202)</p>
<p>"“The thing Kurt seemed to want most in a story,” his student Ronni
Sandroff recalls, “was to be surprised. He once challenged us to
pause before we turned to the next page in a book and try to guess
how the sentence we were in the middle of would end. “You’ll almost
always get it right,” he said." (page 212)</p>
<p>"He warned against tiresomeness. He urged originality, freshness."
(page 212)</p>
<p>"Nothing in real life ends. “Millicent at last understands.” Nobody
ever understands." (page 215)</p>
<p>"it strikes me as gruesome and comical that in our culture we have
an expectation that a man can always solve his problems. There is
that implication that if you just have a little more energy, a
little more fight, the problem can always be solved. This is so
untrue that it makes me want to cry—or laugh." (page 270)</p>
<p>"“Since I took up carpentry,” Mark the pediatrician avows, “I
measure children much more carefully, sometimes to 1/32 of an
inch.”" (page 351)</p>
