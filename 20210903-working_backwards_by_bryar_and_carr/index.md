# Working Backwards, by Bryar and Carr

It's kind of an [ad][] for the authors' consulting, but it's also
interesting to hear how Amazon works. They quote a lot of
[shareholder letters][] (NDA concerns?) and are no doubt biased, but
some Amazon ideas seem okay. The chapter organization is decent:

[ad]: https://www.workingbackwards.com/
[shareholder letters]: https://ir.aboutamazon.com/annual-reports-proxies-and-shareholder-letters/


 1. "Building Blocks: [Leadership Principles][] and Mechanisms"
     * I've heard there are also team-specific (and other?)
       "[tenets][]" that sort of layer on top of the Leadership
       Principles.
 2. "Hiring: Amazon's Unique Bar Raiser Process"
     * Quite structured, focused on specifics/data/anecdotes, with a
       facilitator expert in hiring process.
 3. "Organizing: Separable, Single-Threaded Leadership"
     * Make it somebody's only responsibility. They don't use
       [two-pizza teams][] that much any more, but this
       single-threaded idea is still emphasized.
 4. "Communicating: Narratives and the Six-Pager"
     * They listened to [Tufte][]! No PowerPoint!
 5. "Working Backwards: Start with the Desired Customer Experience"
     * They write a press release and FAQ for the thing, as if they're
       launching it today, before they decide to do it at all.
 6. "Metrics: Manage Your Inputs, Not Your Outputs"
     * Makes a lot of sense, assuming you really know how inputs
       connect to outputs... Studying that is probably somebody's job.

And then they talk about Kindle, Prime, Prime Video, and AWS in part two.

Around page 12, they talk about how the Leadership Principles tried to
capture the culture, not create it. They were first listed in
2004-2005, ten years after Amazon was founded.

> "The metrics used to measure progress were agreed upon. For example,

> Displayed, weighted at 60 percent; and Inventory Holding Cost,
> weighted at 40 percent." (page 70)

Reading this quickly, it seems to make sense. But the values are on
different scales: one is between zero and one (I hope) and the other
is a cost, presumably measured in dollars. So what is this really?

Also, for product pages, an ebook is always in stock, so is there an
incentive to show ebooks rather than physical books? Is that
desirable?

There's some interesting organizational psychology here; maybe it's
obvious, but it seems interesting to me.

This kind of thing is fascinating - often I would never guess the real
behavior of real people, on average.

Seems like this phrase shows up sometimes on Amazon job descriptions...

Wrapping up with recommendations:

> * "Ban PowerPoint
> * Establish the Bar Raiser hiring process
> * Focus on controllable input metrics
> * Move to an organizational structure that accomodates autonomous
>   teams with single-threaded leaders
> * Revise the compensation structure for leaders
> * Articulate the core elements of the company's culture
> * Define a set of leadership principles
> * Depict your flywheel" (pulled from pages 261-262)
