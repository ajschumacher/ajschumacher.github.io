<h1>AI Superpowers, by Lee</h1>
<p class="date">Saturday September 26, 2020</p>
<p>There's a lot <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kai-Fu_Lee">Kai-fu Lee</a> isn't wrong about in <a href="https://www.aisuperpowers.com/">AI Superpowers</a>.
The major break-through of deep learning has occurred, and
applications are now more engineering than invention (cf. <a href="/20200728-technological_revolutions_and_financial_capital/">Perez</a>).
China has data, entrepreneurs, engineers, and government support for
AI. Compared to the US, China has fewer ethical qualms and democratic
controls, which Lee propagandizes as advantages for China. I think
he's right that we should worry more about human society than about
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence">AGI</a>, but I think he exaggerates the exceptionalism of AI.</p>
<p>The boundary between AI and non-AI computing isn't clear. There have
been industrial robots for years. Does it matter whether Google search
is powered by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank">PageRank</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BERT_(language_model)">BERT</a>? It's hard to pin down exactly
what's AI and what isn't. But this isn't my main objection.</p>
<p>There has <em>already been</em> a trend toward concentration of corporate
power, economic inequality, and unemployment/underemployment. The main
problem with Harari's "<a href="https://ideas.ted.com/the-rise-of-the-useless-class/">useless class</a>" idea is his use of the
future tense. The useless class is here already.</p>
<p>It might be better to discuss issues of the future of society in
connections with AI rather than not at all, but I worry that the focus
on AI can distract from trends and approaches that aren't tied to AI.
It isn't useful to make new AI a scapegoat for existing phenomena.</p>
<p>I think Lee overestimates the magnitude of AI's direct impact on jobs,
but maybe not the magnitude of the overall trend in jobs. Regardless,
he then spends the back of the book opining on public policy after his
come-to-Jesus (not literally) experience with cancer. He praises
volunteers and then proposes that we must pay people for things they
would volunteer to do if they didn't have to worry about money. I
don't oppose paying teachers (etc.) more, but I think he's
fundamentally wrong about how humans work, and I think he's way
outside his area of expertise.</p>

<h3>Selected quotes and (rarely) commentary</h3>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"In my view, that [Chinese/US] lead in AI development will translate
into productivity gains on a scale not seen since the Industrial
Revolution." (page 18)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Based on the current trends in technology advancement and adoption,
I predict that within fifteen years, artificial intelligence will
technically be able to replace around 40 to 50 percent of jobs in
the United States. Actual job losses may end up lagging those
technical capabilities by an additional decade, but I forecast that
the disruption to job markets will be very real, very large, and
coming soon." (page 19)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Published in 2018, so that's capability by 2033 and job losses by
2043.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"The AI world order will combine winner-take-all economics with an
unprecedented concentration of wealth in the hands of a few
companies in China and the United States. This, I believe, is the
real underlying threat posed by artificial intelligence: tremendous
social disorder and political collapse stemming from widespread
unemployment and gaping inequality." (page 21)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Entry into the country's imperial bureaucracy depended on
word-for-word memorization of ancient texts and the ability to
construct a perfect "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight-legged_essay">eight-legged essay</a>" following rigid
stylistic guidelines." (page 27)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"But what these critics miss is that this process
[of Chinese central government support] can be both highly
inefficient and extraordinarily effective." (page 65)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Lucky for them, these [Chinese] cities are also home to large pools
of migrant laborers who would gladly bring that service to their
door for a small fee." (page 69)</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>AI is "the defining technology of the twenty-first century." (page
80)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"As I laid out earlier, creating an AI superpower for the
twenty-first century requires four main building blocks: abundant
data, tenacious entrepreneurs, well-trained AI scientists, and a
supportive policy environment." (page 82)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"The complete AI revolution will take a little time and will
ultimately wash over us in a series of four waves: internet AI,
business AI, perception AI, and autonomous AI." (page 105)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"And judicial biases can be far less malicious than racism: a study
of Israeli judges found them far more severe in their decision
before lunch and more lenient in granting parole after having a good
meal." (page 116)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even if this well-known judge study were replicated and broadly
believed (which it is <a href="http://nautil.us/blog/impossibly-hungry-judges">not</a>), Lee's reference is still rather
appalling excuse-making for racist algorithms.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Chinese and American internet companies have taken different
approaches to winning local markets,
[China supporting local companies, America expanding into markets directly]
and as these AI services filter out to every corner of the world,
they may engage in proxy competition in countries like India,
Indonesia, and parts of the Middle East and Africa." (page 139)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"We looked at technical fixes that seek to smooth the transition to
an AI economy: retraining workers, reducing work hours, and
redistributing income through a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_basic_income">UBI</a>. While all of these
technical fixes have a role to play, I believe something more is
needed. I envision the private sector creatively fostering
human-machine symbiosis, a new wave of impact investing funding
human-centric service jobs, and the government filling the gaps with
a social investment stipend that rewards care, service, and
education." (page 224-225)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"In revamping our education systems, we can learn much from South
Korea's embrace of gifted and talented education. These programs
seek to identify and realize the potential of the country's top
technical minds, an approach suited to creating the material
prosperity that can then be broadly shared across society." (page
229)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Describes <a href="https://www.smartfinancegroup.com/static/publish/en_aboutus.html">Smart Finance</a> as a technological leap-frog AI success
story (page 112-113) but many would describe it as a privacy and
fairness nightmare.</p>
