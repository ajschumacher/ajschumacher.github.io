# The Ten Equations that Rule the World, by Sumpter

[Sumpter][] has Bill Nye applied math energy. His central gimmick—a
secret society of people who know math—is a bit much. He's most
interesting when connecting equations and philosophy, but he likes
logical positivism more than his hero Ayers [did][], and his ultimate
appeal to ethical intuitionism is unsatisfying. Still very interesting
in places, and I'm generally with him.

I like the core idea of trying to distill a lot of understanding into
a few core concepts. I think Sumpter's book highlights both the
promise and challenge of attempting this.

Here are the names Sumpter uses for his equations (and more
conventional names):

1. The Judgment Equation (Bayes' theorem)
2. The Betting Equation (Logistic regression)
3. The Confidence Equation (Normal confidence intervals)
4. The Skill Equation (Markov property; memorylessness)
5. The Influencer Equation (Stationary distribution; PageRank)
6. The Market Equation (A sort of autoregressive differential model?)
7. The Advertising Equation (Correlation coefficient)
8. The Reward Equation (Exponential moving average; Q-learning)
9. The Learning Equation (Derivative of quadratic loss; gradient
   descent)
10. The Universal Equation (If-then; trying to get from "is" to
    "ought")


With the exception of #6, I was reasonably familiar with all of these.
My failure to feel connected to the literature (or even what a common
name might be) for #6 makes me feel that this book might not be the
best way to encounter these ideas for the first time.

He's a professor of applied math, after all.

Neat! I think I hadn't heard this story before.

I had some wonderings like this while reading [Mindf*ck][]...
