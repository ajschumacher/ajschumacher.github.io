<h1>The Ten Equations that Rule the World, by Sumpter</h1>
<p class="date">Monday January 16, 2023</p>
<p><a href="https://www.david-sumpter.com/" title="David Sumpter">Sumpter</a> has Bill Nye applied math energy. His central gimmick—a
secret society of people who know math—is a bit much. He's most
interesting when connecting equations and philosophy, but he likes
logical positivism more than his hero Ayers <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language,_Truth,_and_Logic#Ayer's_later_rejection_of_logical_positivism" title="Wikipedia: Ayer's later rejection of logical positivism">did</a>, and his ultimate
appeal to ethical intuitionism is unsatisfying. Still very interesting
in places, and I'm generally with him.</p>
<p>I like the core idea of trying to distill a lot of understanding into
a few core concepts. I think Sumpter's book highlights both the
promise and challenge of attempting this.</p>
<p><img alt="cover" src="cover.jpg" /></p>
<p>Here are the names Sumpter uses for his equations (and more
conventional names):</p>
<ol>
<li>The Judgment Equation (Bayes' theorem)</li>
<li>The Betting Equation (Logistic regression)</li>
<li>The Confidence Equation (Normal confidence intervals)</li>
<li>The Skill Equation (Markov property; memorylessness)</li>
<li>The Influencer Equation (Stationary distribution; PageRank)</li>
<li>The Market Equation (A sort of autoregressive differential model?)</li>
<li>The Advertising Equation (Correlation coefficient)</li>
<li>The Reward Equation (Exponential moving average; Q-learning)</li>
<li>The Learning Equation (Derivative of quadratic loss; gradient
   descent)</li>
<li>The Universal Equation (If-then; trying to get from "is" to
    "ought")</li>
</ol>
<p>With the exception of #6, I was reasonably familiar with all of these.
My failure to feel connected to the literature (or even what a common
name might be) for #6 makes me feel that this book might not be the
best way to encounter these ideas for the first time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The first lesson to draw from Bayes's rule, the judgment equation,
is that we should be slow to draw definitive conclusions." (page 15)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Many people think of math as being all about objectivity; it's not.
It is a way of representing and arguing about the world, and
sometimes the things we argue about are known only to us." (page 24)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He's a professor of applied math, after all.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Much of mathematical modeling is about dividing the world into
understandable component parts, ..." (page 63)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"What I hadn't understood when I started working with sports
statistics was just how much time I would have to sit listening to
men telling me why they believed they were the special one." (page
85)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"When Andrey Markov first wrote down his equation, he wasn't
interested in modeling sporting excellence. He was interested in
great literature. In 1913, he presented, at the Russian Royal
Academy of Sciences, an analysis of the first chapter and parts of
the second chapter of Pushkin's novel <em>Eugene Onegin.</em> In his
analysis of these twenty thousand Russian letters, he determined the
probability of sequences of vowels and consonants. He constructed a
model that predicted, based on the letter that had just occurred in
a text, whether a vowel or a consonant was more likely to occur as
the next character. In doing so, Markov had created a model for
creating new Pushkin works, one character at a time." (page 92)</p>

<p>Neat! I think I hadn't heard this story before.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Accurate reporting of assumptions is just as important as accurate
reporting of results." (page 99)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The salaries offered by tech giants were enough to lure even the
purest of mathematicians." (page 113)</p>

<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"The division of the world into models, data, and nonsense gave the
members of TEN a sense of certainty." (page 122)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"I had researched Cambridge Analytica's algorithm in detail during
2017, the year before the scandal broke, and reached a conclusion
that contradicted both Nix and Wylie's versions of events. I doubted
that the company could have influenced the US presidential election.
They had certainly tried, but the methods they claimed to have used
to target voters were flawed." (page 146)</p>
<p>"Working on the inside, he [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Kogan_(scientist)" title="Wikipedia: Aleksandr Kogan (scientist)">Alex Kogan</a>] had reached the same
conclusion about Cambridge Analytica as I had. He phrased it
politely at the Senate hearing. To me, he said, “That shit doesn't
work.”" (page 164)</p>
<p>"Instead of looking for the real reasons for the rise of
nationalistic sentiment that had brought Donald Trump to power, that
had caused Brexit, that was responsible for the Five Star movement
in Italy, Viktor Orbán in Hungary, and Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil,
everyone seemed to be rushing to find a James Bond-type villain, an
evil individual who had poisoned the political waters. Their Dr. No
came in the form of Alexander Nix and his company, Cambridge
Analytica. Somehow this man, with only a basic understanding of
models and data, was seen to have manipulated the whole of modern
democracy." (page 168)</p>

<p>I had some wonderings like this while reading <a href="https://planspace.org/20221029-mindf*ck_by_wylie/" title="Mindf*ck, by Wylie">Mindf*ck</a>...</p>

<p>"The organization Tristan Harris cofounded, the
<a href="https://www.humanetech.com/">Center for Humane Technology</a>, has advice about how to take
control and move your own mind away from the tipping point." (page

<p>Page 187 mentions lazy ants, but is apparently unaware of follow-up
research. (<a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170908205356.htm" title="Lazy ants make themselves useful in unexpected ways">coverage</a>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Price believed, building on the philosophy of Plato, that
mathematics provided a truth that was independent of our physical
reality and that this truth told us the ethical thing to do. But A.
J. Ayer seemed to overwrite this view in the mid-twentieth century,
arguing with his principle of verifiability that we can't expect to
find any answers to moral questions in math. A mathematics that is
independent of physical reality, he demonstrated, is impossible to
verify." (page 209)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"The sheer number of mathematical theorems that have proved to be
true led French mathematician Henri Poincaré to reflect in his 1902
book, <em>Science and Hypothesis,</em> that “if all the assertions which
mathematics puts forward can be derived from one another by formal
logic, mathematics cannot amount to anything more than an immense
tautology. Logical inference can teach us nothing essentially new
... But can we really allow that these theorems which fill so many
books serve no other purpose than to say in a roundabout fashion
that ‘A = A’?”" (page 214)</p>
<p>"In response to the rhetorical tone used by Poincaré, Ayer wrote,
“The power of logic and mathematics to surprise us depends, like
their usefulness, on the limitations of our reason.”" (page 216)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"I have come to believe that there is a very simple answer to these
dilemmas: we should learn to trust and use our own ethical
intuitions." (page 222)</p>
<p>"I don't have any conclusive proof, but I believe that after logical
positivism strips away the idea of a universal utilitarianism, we
are left with moral intuition to guide us. It is this soft way of
thinking that tells us which problems to solve." (page 223)</p>
<p>"We need to be soft when we define our problems and brutally hard
when we solve them." (page 223)</p>
