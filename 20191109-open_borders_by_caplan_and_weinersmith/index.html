<h1>Open Borders, by Caplan and Weinersmith</h1>
<p class="date">Saturday November  9, 2019</p>
<p>I'd heard about some of <a href="http://www.bcaplan.com/">Caplan</a>'s books, but I hadn't read any
until the guy who does <a href="http://smbc-comics.com/">SMBC</a> advertised the one he worked with
Caplan on. It's a comic book that reads in an evening. I'm glad it's
out there, but I'm not sure the book will change many minds.</p>
<p>The first chapter is called "Global Apartheid," which seems to be
typical of Caplan's flare for the provocative. I don't think the
current system of national borders is quite the same as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid">apartheid</a>.
I didn't think it was a good choice to start the book with this
heading, which risks destroying the appearance of arguing in good
faith.</p>
<p>The comic medium can probably be persuasive, but this book sometimes
prioritizes cartoon over argument. For example, on page 34 a central
result from <a href="https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.25.3.83">a paper by Clemens</a> is mentioned, and the next four
pages illustrate the largeness of an amount of money, while I still
wasn't convinced about how the result was obtained.</p>
<p>It sometimes seems that Caplan isn't aware of how he might sound to
readers. On page 36:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Open borders isn't 'trickle-down economics.' It's Niagara Falls
economics!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Caplan is pictured going over Niagara Falls in an open barrel. Is this
supposed to be a good thing? If you think trickle-down economics is a
fraud, is this larger version a bigger fraud? The comparison and
imagery are not effective.</p>
<p>On page 39, Caplan jokes (?) that if not for borders being relatively
open for academics, he would work at Harvard rather than George Mason
University. This suggests a "yes, some people won't get their
preferred jobs" discussion, which isn't addressed.</p>
<p>I was hoping to find a compelling book that argues strongly for open
borders. This one does introduce a lot of arguments, and it may even
be correct throughout, but the overall effect is not as coherent and
convincing as I had hoped it would be.</p>
