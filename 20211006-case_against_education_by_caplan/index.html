<h1>The Case Against Education, by Caplan</h1>
<p class="date">Wednesday October  6, 2021</p>
<p>Caplan thinks students aren't learning—“The vast majority are
philistines”—so we should stop trying to teach them. I agree with
Caplan on some of his premises, but I don't follow him all the way to
his libertarian recommendations.</p>
<p>Should everyone be pushed toward college as if it's the only
acceptable path? Probably not. More vocational education seems like a
fine idea. I agree there's a signaling component (possibly large) to
the personal benefit of education, and that many people don't learn as
much as it seems like they should.</p>
<p>Caplan turns his back on equality of opportunity when he recommends
letting the market decide on education. I'm not entirely comfortable
with how casually he cites <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/arthur-jensen">Jensen</a> (page 60) or ignores that
effects vary substantially by race even in work he cites (page 150).</p>
<p>I think it's inconsistent to treat education as essentially daycare
but not include the provision of that service in the accounting of
economic benefits.</p>
<p>I think the interesting thing is to consider Caplan's critiques and
think about what really effective education could look like. What
really would build human capital? What would make people wiser,
happier, and more productive?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Bryan Caplan, the foremost whistle-blower in the academy, argues
persuasively that learning about completely arbitrary subjects is
attractive to employers because it signals students' intelligence,
work ethic, desire to please, and conformity—even when such learning
conveys no cognitive advantage or increase in human capital." (cover
blurb from Stephen J. Ceci)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Learning doesn't have to be useful. Learning doesn't have to be
inspirational. When learning is neither useful nor inspirational,
though, how can we call it anything but wasteful." (page 2)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Few jobs require knowledge of higher mathematics, but over 80% of
high school grads suffer through geometry. Students study history
for years, but history teachers are almost the only people alive who
use history on the job." (pages 6-7)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Geometry is higher mathematics? But more importantly, isn't history
important, at least in theory, to having informed voters for
democracy? Caplan later points out that years of history don't usually
yield informed voters in the current system anyway, but it seems
inappropriate to completely neglect civic objectives for education.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"...statistics and econometrics courses at elite colleges emphasize
mathematical proofs, not hands-on statistical training." (page 11)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That cites <a href="https://ftp.iza.org/dp10535.pdf">Undergraduate Econometrics Instruction: Through Our Classes, Darkly</a>, which includes the following in its abstract:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Questions of research design and causality still take a back seat
in the classroom, in spite of having risen to the top of the modern
empirical agenda. This essay traces the divergent development of
econometric teaching and empirical practice, arguing for a
pedagogical paradigm shift."</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Higher education is the only product where the consumer tries to
get as little out of it as possible." (page 26, quoting Arnold
Kling, sort of)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The citation is <a href="https://www.econlib.org/archives/2006/08/college_custome.html">College Customers vs. Suppliers</a>, in which Kling writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I recall seeing a quote somewhere else to the effect that higher
education is the only product where the consumer tries to get as
little out of it as possible."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So who knows where the quote comes from!</p>
<p>Kling proposes separating testing from teaching, to align students and
professors in the direction of rigor rather than easy A's. Maybe so?</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Basic literacy and numeracy are virtually the <em>only</em> book learning
most American adults possess." (page 40)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Though college grads spend at least seventeen years in school,
under a third have the level of literacy and numeracy we assume of
every college freshman." (page 43)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Note: Statisticians routinely rely on the approximate equality
between logged variables and percentages. However, when coefficients
are large, this approximation breaks down, so I convert results to
percentages for clarity." (page 302, endnote 8 from page 73)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't think this is very clear. What it's getting at is that if
you're fitting a linear model, then a logged outcome variable makes
the additive model multiplicative in the original outcome, so a 0.02
change in the regression outcome is a 2% change in the original
outcome. Gelman has a decent <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2019/08/21/you-should-usually-log-transform-your-positive-data/">intro</a>, maybe. Or <a href="https://people.duke.edu/~rnau/411log.htm">this</a>, which
notes that "small changes in the natural log of a variable are
directly interpretable as percentage changes, to a very close
approximation" and even a nice table showing how the approximation
breaks down.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Most strikingly, the standard measure of "fatalism," the Rotter
Internal-External Locus of Control Scale, is a four-question
personality test. (page 303, endnote 24 from page 75)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is misleading. The <a href="https://www.mccc.edu/~jenningh/Courses/documents/Rotter-locusofcontrolhandout.pdf" title="Rotter's Locus of Control Scale">Rotter</a> instrument has 29 questions. But
Caplan is citing <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w12006" title="The Effects of Cognitive and Noncognitive Abilities on Labor Market Outcomes and Social Behavior">a 2006 paper</a> that uses <a href="https://www.bls.gov/nls/nlsy79.htm" title="National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979">NLSY79</a> data, which
does indeed <a href="https://www.nlsinfo.org/content/cohorts/nlsy79/other-documentation/codebook-supplement/nlsy79-appendix-21-attitudinal-scales#rotter">include</a> a "four-item abbreviated version of the Rotter
Internal External Locus of Control Scale"—sort of.</p>
<p>NLSY79 included Rotter questions 28, 13, 15, and 25 (in that order)
and in addition to asking respondents to choose one of two statements
for each, also asked whether their choice was "much closer" or
"slightly closer" to their view. So it's an eight-question instrument
(or at least, it yields eight bits of information).</p>
<p>There are multiple tests for internal-external locus of control, some
<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00223891.1974.10119987" title="An Abbreviated Measure of Internal-External Locus of Control">shorter</a> than 29 questions, some <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1973-21097-001" title="A locus of control scale for children">longer</a>. If you do want a
four-question instrument, consider Kovaleva's <a href="https://www.ssoar.info/ssoar/bitstream/handle/document/37119/ssoar-2012-kovaleva-The_IE-4_Construction_and_Validation.pdf" title="The IE-4: Construction and Validation of a Short Scale for the Assessment of Locus of Control">IE-4</a> (four
five-point Likert scale questions; see Table 26 on page 81).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"<em>Signals can affect pay even after employers know the truth.</em>
Employer learning researchers speak as if the payoff for signaling
ends as soon as employers know a worker's true worth. They should be
more circumspect. For starters, firms often give new workers
valuable on-the-job training. As a result, signaling can indirectly
boost your productivity. Step 1: Signal in school. Step 2: Land a
good job. Step 3: Learn useful job skills on the job. Step 4:
Persistently profit. If your signal modestly overstates your skill,
your imployer may soon wish they'd hired someone else. By the time
they spot their mistake, however, your new marketable skills
permanently justify higher pay." (page 112)</p>

<p>Following the endnote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"While research on this story is sparse, Heisz and Oreopoulos 2006
report the payoff for high-ranked M.B.A. and law degrees <em>increases</em>
with experience, even correcting for individual ability, because
high-ranked degrees lead to good first jobs, which lead to even
better jobs down the line." (page 312)</p>

<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"The Higher Education Research Institute has questioned college
freshmen about their goals since the 1970s. The vast majority is
openly careerist and materialist. In 2012, almost 90% called "being
able to get a better job" a "very important" or "essential" reason
to go to college. Being "very well-off financially" (over 80%) and
"making more money" (about 75%) are almost as popular. Less than
half say the same about "developing a meaningful philosophy of
life." These results are especially striking because humans
exaggerate their idealism and downplay their selfishness. Students
probably prize worldly success even more than they admit." (page

<p>"The High School Survey of Student Engagement, probably the single
best study of how high school students feel about school, reports
that 66% of high school students say they're bored in class <em>every
day</em>. Seventeen percent say they're bored in <em>every</em> class <em>every</em>
day. Only 2% claim they're never bored in class. Why so bored?
Eighty-two percent say the material isn't interesting; 41% say the
material isn't relevant. Another research team gave beepers to
middle school students to capture their feelings in real time.
During schoolwork, students were bored 36% of the time, versus 17%
for all other activities. No wonder a major Gates Foundation study
ranked boredom the <em>most</em> important reason why kids drop out of high
school." (page 135)</p>

<p>"How much does your alma mater's rank matter? Research is oddly

<p>The endnote points to <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.23.4.95">Hoxby 2009</a>, which is about college
selectivity, not how much it matters to student outcomes. It's
interesting though; here's the abstract:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Over the past few decades, the average college has not become more
selective: the reverse is true, though not dramatically. People who
believe that college selectivity is increasing may be extrapolating
from the experience of a small number of colleges such as members of
the Ivy League, Stanford, Duke, and so on. These colleges have
experienced rising selectivity, but their experience turns out to be
the exception rather than the rule. Only the top 10 percent of
colleges are substantially more selective now than they were
in 1962. Moreover, at least 50 percent of colleges are substantially
less selective now than they were in 1962. To understand changing
selectivity, we must focus on how the market for college education
has re-sorted students among schools as the costs of distance and
information have fallen. In the past, students' choices were very
sensitive to the distance of a college from their home, but today,
students, especially high-aptitude students, are far more sensitive
to a college's resources and student body. It is the consequent
re-sorting of students among colleges that has, at once, caused
selectivity to rise in a small number of colleges while
simultaneously causing it to fall in other colleges. This has had
profound implications for colleges' resources, tuition, and
subsidies for students. I demonstrate that the stakes associated
with choosing a college are greater today than they were four
decades ago because very selective colleges are offering very large
per-student resources and per-student subsidies, enabling admitted
students to make massive human capital investments."</p>

<p>"Their [Dale and Krueger's] most amazing discovery is that students
who <em>submit</em> lots of applications to high-quality schools enjoy
exceptional career success whether or not they attend such schools."

<p>The citation is <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/23799087" title="Estimating the Effects of College Characteristics over the Career Using Administrative Earnings Data">Dale and Krueger 2014</a>, which has this abstract:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We estimate the labor market effect of attending a highly selective
college, using the College and Beyond Survey linked to Social
Security Administration data. We extend earlier work by estimating
effects for students that entered college in 1976 over a longer time
horizon (from 1983 through 2007) and for a more recent cohort
(1989). For both cohorts, the effects of college characteristics on
earnings are sizeable (and similar in magnitude) in standard
regression models. In selection-adjusted models, these effects
generally fall to close to zero; however, these effects remain large
for certain subgroups, such as for black and Hispanic students."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's the last sentence that matters. Caplan only read the first half
of that one, somehow, which I think is a substantial mistake.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"As long as your state's best public school admits you, there's no
solid reason to pay more." (page 153)</p>

<p>If you're white. I mean, <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/23799087" title="Estimating the Effects of College Characteristics over the Career Using Administrative Earnings Data">Dale and Krueger 2014</a> is <em>his</em>
citation—how can he ignore that?</p>

<p>"Doing <em>any</em> job teaches you how to do a job. If this seems a low
bar, recall that almost half of dropouts and a third of high school

</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>On page 239, Caplan quotes at some length from Malcolm X describing
how he copied a dictionary in prison. It's a bit Hirsch-like, this
advocacy for content, for volume...</p>

<p>"The straightforward story, though, is that high culture requires
extra mental effort to appreciate—and most humans resent mental
effort." (page 247)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Measuring effects issue by issue neatly explains education's
puzzlingly small impact on ideology and party. Since education
simultaneously increases social liberalism <em>and</em> economic
conservatism, its effect on "liberalism" is ambiguous. And while
their social liberalism makes the well-educated more Democratic,
their economic conservatism makes them more Republican, leaving
partisanship nearly untouched." (page 333, endnote 36 from page 249)</p>

<p>"When you run out of ideas, assign a random Wikipedia article. ...
Start with the Bureau of Labor Statistics' figures on "employment by

unfamiliar job from the Bureau of Labor Statistics' <em>Occupational
Outlook Handbook</em>." (page 256)</p>

<p>I do kind of like some of this. In particular, I feel like I didn't
learn in school much of anything about what jobs exist or what people
really do in them.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"I'm cynical about students. The vast majority are philistines. The
best teachers in the universe couldn't inspire them with sincere and
lasting love of ideas and culture. I'm cynical about teachers. The
vast majority are uninspiring; they can't convince even <em>themselves</em>
to love ideas and culture, much less their students. I'm cynical
about "deciders"—the school officials who control what students
study. The vast majority think they've done their job as long as
students obey." (page 259)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"I don't hate education. Rather I love education too much to accept
our Orwellian substitute." (page 260)</p>

<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"As Stanford education professor David Labaree remarks, "Motivating
volunteers to engage in human improvement is very difficult, as any
psychotherapist can confirm, but motivating conscripts is quite
another thing altogether. And it is conscripts that teachers face

<p>"Many idealists object that the Internet provides enlightenment only
for those who seek it. They're right, but petulant to ask for more."

</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Most humans intrigued by abstract ideas and high culture are
working adults. Instead of lamenting youthful apathy, passionate
educators should redirect their energy to humans who are <em>ready</em> for
enlightenment. There is little money in blogging, podcasting, or
uploading lectures to YouTube. But if, like me, you love education
to the depths of your soul, such efforts are their own reward."
