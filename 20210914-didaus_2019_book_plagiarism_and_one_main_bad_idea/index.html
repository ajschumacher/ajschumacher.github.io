<h1>Didau's 2019 book: Plagiarism and one main bad idea</h1>
<p class="date">Tuesday September 14, 2021</p>
<p>Former English teacher David Didau seems to have <a href="#plagiarism">plagiarised</a>
Wikipedia in his book called <em>Making kids cleverer</em>. At least it's
less into eugenics than his <a href="/20210914-david_didaus_2015_book_endorses_eugenics/" title="David Didau's 2015 book endorses eugenics">older book</a>. The main bad idea is a
central desire to shape curriculum so as to perpetuate existing
systems of power.</p>
<p>Didau's titular thesis is that the goal of schools is to make kids
cleverer, in the sense of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_and_crystallized_intelligence">crystallized intelligence</a>, by teaching
knowledge, broadly construed. When it comes time to discuss <em>which</em>
knowledge, he pivots from arguing in support of cleverness to arguing
in support of dead white men on the grounds that this knowledge is
culturally valued—implicitly, valued by the culture he values.</p>
<p>I think it's <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/07/what-every-american-should-know/397334/">possible</a> to make an argument for some shared
knowledge, in the tradition of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._D._Hirsch">Hirsch</a>, but I think it's a
different argument than arguing for knowledge that best helps students
think more effectively in the sense of moving toward a global maximum.
Similarly, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect">Lindy effect</a> is about longevity, but not
necessarily quality. I think it would be much more interesting to look
at curriculum design by taking seriously the idea of giving students
the best mental toolkit possible. This is not what Didau does.</p>
<p>Didau discusses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn_effect">Flynn effect</a>, and subscribes to the
"scientific spectacles" interpretation that general skills with
scientific abstraction explain increases in average IQ over time, but
at the same time argues one-sidedly for teaching concrete knowledge,
not general skills.</p>
<p>I do think that students can and probably should learn and remember
much more, generally, than they sometimes do, but Didau is a
problematic advocate, and I don't think his obsession with IQ is
useful.</p>

<hr />
<p>While this is always the case, I feel like it's especially important
with a book like this for me to point out that selected quotes below
do not indicate my agreement with or support for any particular quote.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Over the course of this book, I will explain that, unlike many
other qualities we might value, intelligence has the advantages of
being malleable, measurable and meaningful." (page 7)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"By 'making cleverer' what I really mean, of course, is raising
intelligence—increasing children's intellectual capacity." (page 7)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Arthur Scargill, tub-thumping leader of the National Union of
Mineworkers, who led the opposition to Margaret Thatcher's struggle
to break the power of the trade unions, wrote, "My father still
reads the dictionary every day. He says your life depends on your
power to master words."" (page 9)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Trying to develop children's ability by teaching generic skills
directly is fundamentally unfair. Children with higher fluid
intelligence and those from more advantaged backgrounds will be
further privileged." (page 11)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"This is the central thesis of the book: more knowledge equals more
intelligence." (page 11)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"It's my view that '21st century skills' depend on knowing things
rather than on simply being able to look stuff up on the internet."
(page 12)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Developing children's character depends ont on attempting to
explicitly teach some ephemeral set of 'non-cognitive' skills but on
a combination of high expectations, accountability and modeling. As
Kalenze suggests, probably the best way to teach resilience is to
give children challenging work to do; the best way to teach respect
and politeness is to model it; and the best way to teach children
how to be functional, happy citizens is to set up systems which hold
them to account for their behaviour." (page 25)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"[Kevin] Laland points out that "Humanity's success is sometimes
attributed to our cleverness, but culture is actually what makes us
smart. Intelligence is not irrelevant of course, but what singles
out our species is an ability to pool our insights and knowledge and
build on each other's solutions."" (page 43)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Some children may be born with a greater capacity for solving
problems and thinking critically than others. These children are
lucky. At the same time, some children will possess more (and more
useful) knowledge of the world on which to apply these skills. These
children will tend to be from more privileged backgrounds. What
happens in school matters far less to both these groups of children
than it does to the less fortunate and the less advantaged. The
killer argument against a curriculum that focuses on 21st century
skills—or any other kind of generic competencies—is that it is
inherently iniquitous." (page 45)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"The purpose of schools, as much as anything else, is to provide an
environment where children are made to attend to what they would
otherwise prefer to avoid." (page 53)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"... the position I will advance in this book is that intelligence
is as much a product of what we know as it is a mechanism for
acquiring knowledge." (page 57)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Although we might perceive some children to be more 'able' than
others, this is unimportant because there's not really anything we
can do about it. We can, however, do an awful lot about developing
the quantity and quality of what children know." (page 60)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"While correlation is not proof that one thing causes another,
causation is implied." (page 65)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This follows shortly after a section called "Correlation ≠ causation"...</p>

Nettle is cited on page 67.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Using the environment to increase crystallised intelligence is
central to making kids cleverer; fluid intelligence, and its
associated individual differences, is largely a distraction." (page
77)</p>

<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"The difference of natural talents in different men is, in reality,
much less than we are aware of ... The difference between the most
dissimilar characters, between a philosopher and a common street
porter, for example, seems to arise not so much from nature as from
habit, custom, and education." (page 85, quoting Adam Smith, The
Wealth of Nations)</p>

<p>And this is <em>good</em> reliability? Hmm.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Whether or not this [set of recommendations for schools] results in
a measurable increase in IQ is largely irrelevant. I think we can
all agree that intellectual curiosity and a lifelong love of
learning are things we want for all children, and these suggestions
seems like a reasonable bet for getting what we want." (page 111)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the title of the book is "Making kids cleverer"... that was the
whole goal you were working on!</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"The rule seems to be that education raises crystallised
intelligence but not fluid intelligence." (page 118)</p>

<p>The earlier bit has no reference.

<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"The main reason children end up not learning what they're taught in
school isn't that they're not capable of remembering it; it's that
their teachers don't sufficiently value kids knowing stuff and don't
use the sorts of consolidation strategies which would help them to
remember." (page 157)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"I have to show you how to use a comma in a wide variety of contexts
and then get you to practise writing correctly punctuated
sentences." (page 179)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So his focus on "knowledge" includes skills and application; not just
memorization.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"The general rule is that expert knowledge always trumps raw
ability." (page 180)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Knowledge is most truly flexible when it is automatised." (page
183)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>On page 183, Didau references a student's test response as "empty and
worthless". His book doesn't include the question prompt visible in
<a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.learningspy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Screen-Shot-2016-11-09-at-15.12.38.png">the original</a>. With that context, the answer doesn't seem so crazy
to me. Doesn't seem like a very good question, really.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"So what does it mean to be skilled at making inferences? Nothing:
it is indistinguishable from being knowledgeable." (page 186)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"We are unable to think with anything that we are dependent on
looking up." (page 191)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"It's only when people ask us to explain what we think we know that
we find out whether we know it." (page 197)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Many references to Michael Young's "powerful knowledge" idea. Here's
one <a href="https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1085994.pdf">applied explainer</a> I found. I also stumbled on this
<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323587483_The_Weakness_of_Powerful_Knowledge">critique</a>, which includes in its abstract: "The first part of the
article focuses on the definitional connection that Young makes
between 'powerful knowledge' and systematic relationships between
concepts. It argues that most of the school subjects that Young sees
as providing 'powerful knowledge' fall short on this requirement."</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Being able to quote Shakespeare or knowing Pythagoras' theorem may
seem like trivia, but it enables us to access society in a way which
would be impossible if we didn't know any of this." (page 209)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"One much chewed bone of contention is who gets to decide what
knowledge children should learn. The assumption seems to be that
there's some shadowy elite inflicting their preferences on the rest
of us. This is nonsense. No one chooses; we all choose. No one
person knows enough to make this choice but collectively we have
access to the vast accumulation of human culture. The most important
things to know are those things that last and which most influence
other cultural developments; those things that inspire the most
'conversations' backwards and forwards through time and across
space; those things that allow us to trace our cultural inheritance
through threads of thought from the discoveries of modern science
and the synthesis of modern art back to their ancient origins."
(page 210)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a mess on multiple levels. Leaving aside the most obvious
issues around who he means by "we", he's abandoned his original claim
of arguing for making children cleverer: lasting a long time and being
culturally popular does not imply useful for thought, and then we're
back to who he means when he says "our cultural inheritance".</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"On the face of it, building a curriculum around the thoughts and
deeds of historically marginalised groups looks like a really good
idea. Who wouldn't want children to know about the achievements of
women and people of colour? The trouble is, this isn't shared
knowledge. It doesn't allow access to the 'knowledge of power', and,
crucially, it doesn't provide much cultural capital." (page 211)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What happened to making children cleverer? Say, by giving them access
to the powerful idea that everyone can contribute to society, not just
historically dominant (not to say oppressive) people?</p>
<p>Maybe he's arguing against a curriculum based <em>only</em> on historically
marginalised groups, to the exclusion of his buddy Shakespeare, say?</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Does it add to children's knowledge of what others in society
consider to be valuable?" (page 218)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the <em>first</em> in Didau's list of desiderata for what to teach.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"The epistemology of most sciences, for example, is often based upon
experimentation and discovery and, since this is so, experimentation
and discovery should be apart of any curriculum aimed at 'producing'
future scientists. But this does not mean that experimentation and
discovery should also be the basis for curriculum organization and
learning-environment designing." (quoting Paul Kirschner, page 223)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think the opposite (not teaching students <em>about</em> experimentation
and discovery, and letting them try it <em>at least a little</em>) is also a
mistake.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"We've already seen that the best way to learn the solutions to
problems is not by solving problems. Problem solving is the means by
which new knowledge might be added to the domain; it is not an
effective means of learning the knowledge already within the
domain." (page 224)</p>
<p>"Solving problems is an inefficient way to get better at problem
solving." (page 236)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This sounds very strange from a math teacher's perspective, where the
goal is often to teach students <em>to solve problems</em>, and some even say
the only way to learn it is to solve problems. Here's Lockhart:
"Mental acuity of any kind comes from solving problems yourself, not
from being told how to solve them."</p>
<hr />
<p>Didau's second requirement for a curriculum is that it is "Culturally
rich. (Does the selected content conform to shared cultural agreements
of what is considered valuable to know?)" (page 224)</p>
<p>On page 225 he summarizes "Some knowledge is more culturally rich than
other knowledge — that is, more valued within society."</p>
<p>There is a separate case to be made, maybe, for knowing what other
people know so that you can communicate with them, walk the halls of
power, etc. But it is not, in my opinion, the same as a case for some
knowledge making you cleverer. The argument that historically dominant
knowledge is the best knowledge is problematic.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"As experts, we often assume that others share the same background
knowledge as us and so it often goes unsaid. And where expert
knowledge is stated, all too often it isn't understood. Experts are
unaware of the extent of their knowledge and end up speaking in
maxims. As we saw in Chapter 7, such maxims are easily understood by
other experts but are meaningless to novices. Where a novice will be
confused and frustrated by gaps in explanation, an expert fills them
within even realising they're doing it. Such is the curse of
knowledge. This lack of insight into the source of expertise can
lead us into neglecting the teaching of the vital nuts and bolts on
which our expert performances depend." (page 234)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"It's worth noting that we can't create mental representations just
through study — we have to get our hands dirty by trying to do the
thing we want to improve at." (page 240)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><a name="plagiarism" href="#plagiarism">Plagiarism</a></h3>
<p>I happened to look up the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expertise_reversal_effect">expertise reversal effect</a> on Wikipedia.
I'll put in bold parts that correspond word for word.</p>
<p>Here's what Didau's book includes on page 245:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<strong><em>The worked-example effect</em></strong> — <strong>worked examples</strong> (<strong>a problem
statement followed by a step-by-step demonstration of how to solve
it</strong>) <strong>are often contrasted with open-ended problem solving in
which the learner is responsible for providing the step-by-step
solution.</strong> Although novices <strong>benefit more from studying structured
worked examples than from solving problems on their own, as
knowledge increases, open-ended problem solving becomes more
effective.</strong>"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Interactions between levels of knowledge and <strong>the worked-example
effect</strong>: <strong>Worked examples</strong> provide <strong>a problem statement followed
by a step-by-step demonstration of how to solve it</strong>. Worked
examples <strong>are often contrasted with open-ended problem solving in

solution.</strong> Low-knowledge learners <strong>benefit more from studying
structured worked</strong>-out <strong>examples than from solving problems on
their own</strong>. However, <strong>as knowledge increases, open-ended problem
solving becomes</strong> the <strong>more effective</strong> learning activity."</p>

<p>"Attempting to follow along in their own copy of a text while
simultaneously having to listen as the text is read aloud is
impossible. Children are forced to task switch between the printed
material and the sound of the teacher's voice, meaning they lose
track of what it is they're supposed to be reading and remember far
less than if they had either read or listened without trying to do
both at once." (page 261)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is presented without citation. It would be interesting if it was
supported by some evidence. I feel like I remember plenty of following
along in texts while others read in my early education at least, and I
don't recall it being difficult. References welcome.</p>
