# Didau's 2019 book: Plagiarism and one main bad idea

Former English teacher David Didau seems to have [plagiarised][]
Wikipedia in his book called _Making kids cleverer_. At least it's
less into eugenics than his [older book][]. The main bad idea is a
central desire to shape curriculum so as to perpetuate existing
systems of power.

[plagiarised]: #plagiarism
[older book]: /20210914-david_didaus_2015_book_endorses_eugenics/ "David Didau's 2015 book endorses eugenics"

Didau's titular thesis is that the goal of schools is to make kids
cleverer, in the sense of [crystallized intelligence][], by teaching
knowledge, broadly construed. When it comes time to discuss _which_
knowledge, he pivots from arguing in support of cleverness to arguing
in support of dead white men on the grounds that this knowledge is
culturally valued—implicitly, valued by the culture he values.

[crystallized intelligence]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_and_crystallized_intelligence

I think it's [possible][] to make an argument for some shared
knowledge, in the tradition of [Hirsch][], but I think it's a
different argument than arguing for knowledge that best helps students
think more effectively in the sense of moving toward a global maximum.
Similarly, the [Lindy effect][] is about longevity, but not
necessarily quality. I think it would be much more interesting to look
at curriculum design by taking seriously the idea of giving students
the best mental toolkit possible. This is not what Didau does.

Didau discusses the [Flynn effect][], and subscribes to the
"scientific spectacles" interpretation that general skills with
scientific abstraction explain increases in average IQ over time, but
at the same time argues one-sidedly for teaching concrete knowledge,
not general skills.

[Flynn effect]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn_effect

I do think that students can and probably should learn and remember
much more, generally, than they sometimes do, but Didau is a
problematic advocate, and I don't think his obsession with IQ is
useful.

On page 183, Didau references a student's test response as "empty and
worthless". His book doesn't include the question prompt visible in
[the original][]. With that context, the answer doesn't seem so crazy
to me. Doesn't seem like a very good question, really.

Many references to Michael Young's "powerful knowledge" idea. Here's
one [applied explainer][] I found. I also stumbled on this
[critique][], which includes in its abstract: "The first part of the
article focuses on the definitional connection that Young makes
between 'powerful knowledge' and systematic relationships between
concepts. It argues that most of the school subjects that Young sees
as providing 'powerful knowledge' fall short on this requirement."

This is a mess on multiple levels. Leaving aside the most obvious
issues around who he means by "we", he's abandoned his original claim
of arguing for making children cleverer: lasting a long time and being
culturally popular does not imply useful for thought, and then we're
back to who he means when he says "our cultural inheritance".

What happened to making children cleverer? Say, by giving them access
to the powerful idea that everyone can contribute to society, not just
historically dominant (not to say oppressive) people?

Maybe he's arguing against a curriculum based _only_ on historically
marginalised groups, to the exclusion of his buddy Shakespeare, say?


---

> "Does it add to children's knowledge of what others in society

This is the _first_ in Didau's list of desiderata for what to teach.


---

I think the opposite (not teaching students _about_ experimentation
and discovery, and letting them try it _at least a little_) is also a
mistake.

This sounds very strange from a math teacher's perspective, where the
goal is often to teach students _to solve problems_, and some even say
the only way to learn it is to solve problems. Here's Lockhart:
"Mental acuity of any kind comes from solving problems yourself, not
from being told how to solve them."


---

Didau's second requirement for a curriculum is that it is "Culturally
rich. (Does the selected content conform to shared cultural agreements
of what is considered valuable to know?)" (page 224)

On page 225 he summarizes "Some knowledge is more culturally rich than
other knowledge — that is, more valued within society."

There is a separate case to be made, maybe, for knowing what other
people know so that you can communicate with them, walk the halls of
power, etc. But it is not, in my opinion, the same as a case for some
knowledge making you cleverer. The argument that historically dominant
knowledge is the best knowledge is problematic.

### <a name="plagiarism" href="#plagiarism">Plagiarism</a>

I happened to look up the [expertise reversal effect][] on Wikipedia.
I'll put in bold parts that correspond word for word.

[expertise reversal effect]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expertise_reversal_effect

Here's what Didau's book includes on page 245:

> "**_The worked-example effect_** — **worked examples** (**a problem
> statement followed by a step-by-step demonstration of how to solve
> it**) **are often contrasted with open-ended problem solving in
> which the learner is responsible for providing the step-by-step
> solution.** Although novices **benefit more from studying structured
> worked examples than from solving problems on their own, as
> knowledge increases, open-ended problem solving becomes more
> effective.**"

Here's Wikipedia:

> "Interactions between levels of knowledge and **the worked-example
> effect**: **Worked examples** provide **a problem statement followed
> by a step-by-step demonstration of how to solve it**. Worked
> examples **are often contrasted with open-ended problem solving in

> structured worked**-out **examples than from solving problems on
> their own**. However, **as knowledge increases, open-ended problem
> solving becomes** the **more effective** learning activity."

I think a teacher grading a paper would have to call this plagiarism.

This is presented without citation. It would be interesting if it was
supported by some evidence. I feel like I remember plenty of following
along in texts while others read in my early education at least, and I
don't recall it being difficult. References welcome.
