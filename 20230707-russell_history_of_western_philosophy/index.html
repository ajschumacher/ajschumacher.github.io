<h1>Russell's History of Western Philosophy</h1>
<p class="date">Friday July  7, 2023</p>
<p>Russell attempts to understand all of western social, political, and
philosophical history in one charming and often funny <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_History_of_Western_Philosophy">book</a>. His
attitude is frequently as expressed on page 760: “This may seem odd,
but that is not my fault.” Russell is a fine guide through the weird
world of human thought, highlighting important developments and gaps.</p>
<p>Summarizing several levels further, here are nine big names in western
philosophy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pythagoras (570–495) mathematical reasoning (also much silliness)</li>
<li>Socrates (470–399) Socratic method (questioning), fixation on definitions</li>
<li>Plato (428–348) Realm of Ideals (and other silliness)</li>
<li>Aristotle (384–322) syllogisms (and fairly bad science)</li>
<li>Descartes (1596–1650) cogito (“I think, therefore I am.”)</li>
<li>Locke (1632–1704) empiricism, social contract</li>
<li>Hume (1711–1776) scepticism re: induction, causation</li>
<li>Kant (1724–1804) Critique of Pure Reason (synthetic a priori), categorical imperative</li>
<li>Hegel (1770–1831) dialectic (thesis/antithesis/synthesis; really from Fichte)</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="cover" src="cover.jpg" /></p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>To teach how to live without certainty, and yet without being
paralyzed by hesitation, is perhaps the chief thing that philosophy,
in our age, can still do for those who study it. (page xiv)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Modern philosophy begins with Descartes, whose fundamental certainty
is the existence of himself and his thoughts, from which the
external world is to be inferred. This was only the first stage in a
development, through Berkeley and Kant, to Fichte, for whom
everything is only an emanation of the ego. This was insanity, and,
from this extreme, philosophy has been attempting, ever since, to
escape into the world of every-day common sense. (page xxi)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Social cohesion is a necessity, and mankind has never yet succeeded
in enforcing cohesion by merely rational arguments. (page xxiii)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>The gentleman is to be defined as one of a society of equals who
live on slave labour, or at any rate upon the labour of men whose
inferiority is unquestioned.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Whatever may be thought of a social system which tolerates slavery,
it is to gentlemen in the above sense that we owe pure mathematics.
(page 34)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>On pages 35-36 Russell notes the Pythagorean schism between arithmetic
and geometry, which led to much confusion.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>The influence of geometry upon philosophy and scientific method has
been profound. Geometry, as established by the Greeks, starts with
axioms which are (or are deemed to be) self-evident, and proceeds,
by deductive reasoning, to arrive at theorems that are very far from
self-evident. The axioms and theorems are held to be true of actual
space, which is something given in experience. It thus appeared to
be possible to discover things about the actual world by first
noticing what is self-evident and then using deduction. This view
influenced Plato and Kant, and most of the intermediate
philosophers. When the Declaration of Independence says “we hold
these truths to be self-evident,” it is modeling itself on Euclid.
The eighteenth-century doctrine of natural rights is a search for
Euclidean axioms in politics. The form of Newton's <em>Principia,</em> in
spite of its admittedly empirical material, is entirely dominated by
Euclid. Theology, in its exact scholastic forms, takes its style
from the same source. Personal religion is derived from ecstasy,
theology from mathematics, and both are to be found in Pythagoras.
(pages 36-37)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>“The certain truth there is no man who knows, nor ever shall be,
about the gods and all the things whereof I speak. Yea, even if a
man should chance to say something utterly right, still he himself
knows it not—there is nowhere anything but guessing.” (page 40,
quoting Xenophanes from Bevan, 1913)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>The search for something permanent is one of the deepest instincts
leading men to philosophy. (page 45)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>One of the main ambitions of philosophers has been to revive hopes
that science seemed to have killed. (page 47)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>... the ethical and religious preoccupations which, passing from the
Pythagoreans to Socrates and from Socrates to Plato, brought an
obscurantist bias into Greek philosophy. (page 63)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Causation must start from something, and wherever it starts no cause
can be assigned for the initial datum. The world may be attributed
to a Creator, but even then the Creator Himself is unaccounted for.
(page 66)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>When we ask “why?” concerning an event, we may mean either of two
things. We may mean: “What purpose did this event serve?” or we may
mean: “What earlier circumstances caused this event?” The answer to
the former question is a teleological explanation, or an explanation
by final causes; the answer to the latter question is a mechanistic
explanation. I do not see how it could have been known in advance
which of these two questions science ought to ask, or whether it
ought to ask both. But experience has shown that the mechanistic
question leads to scientific knowledge, while the teleological
question does not. The atomists asksed the mechanistic question, and
gave a mechanistic answer. Their successors, until the Renaissance,
were more interested in the teleological question, and thus led
science up a blind alley. (page 67)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Plato is always concerned to advocate views that will make people
what he thinks virtuous; he is hardly ever intellectually honest,
because he allows himself to judge doctrines by their social
consequences. Even about this, he is not honest; he pretends to
follow the argument and to be judging by purely theoretical
standards, when in fact he is twisting the discussion so as to lead
to a virtuous result. He introduced this vice into philosophy, where
it has persisted ever since. It was probably largely hostility to
the Sophists that gave this character to his dialogues. One of the
defects of all philosophers since Plato is that their inquiries into
ethics proceed on the assumption that they already know the
conclusions to be reached. (page 79)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>A stupid man's report of what a clever man says is never accurate,
because he unconsciously translates what he hears into something
that he can understand. (page 83)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>The earliest of the Platonic dialogues, which are generally supposed
to be the most Socratic, are mainly occupied with the search for
definitions of ethical terms. The <em>Charmides</em> is concerned with the
definition of temperance or moderation; the <em>Lysis</em> with friendship;
the <em>Laches</em> with courage. In all of these, no conclusion is arrived
at, but Socrates makes it clear that he thinks it important to
examine such questions. The Platonic Socrates consistently maintains
that he knows nothing, and is only wiser than others in knowing that
he knows nothing; but he does not think knowledge unobtainable. On
the contrary, he thinks the search for knowledge of the utmost
importance. He maintains that no man sins wittingly, and therefore
only knowledge is needed to make all men perfectly virtuous.</p>
<p>The close connection between virtue and knowledge is characteristic
of Socrates and Plato. To some degree, it exists in all Greek
thought, as opposed to that of Christianity. In Christian ethics, a
pure heart is the essential, and is at least as likely to be found
among the ignorant as among the learned. This difference between
Greek and Christian ethics has persisted down to the present day.
(pages 91-92)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>It has always been correct to praise Plato, but not to understand
him. This is the common fate of great men. (page 105)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>It seems to us unwise to have insisted on teaching geometry to the
younger Dionysius, tyrant of Syracuse, in order to make him a good
king, but from Plato's point of view it was essential. He was
sufficiently Pythagorean to think that without mathematics no true
wisdom is possible. This view implies oligarchy.</p>
<p>... Plato, in common with most Greek philosophers, took the view
that leisure is essential to wisdom, which will therefore not be
found among those who have to work for their living, but only among
those who have independent means, or who are relieved by the state
from anxieties as to their subsistence. This point of view is
essentially aristocratic. (page 106)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>It might be suggested that men could be given political wisdom by a
suitable training. But the question would arise: what is a suitable
training? And this would turn out to be a party question.</p>
<p>The problem of finding a collection of “wise” men and leaving the
government to them is thus an insoluble one. That is the ultimate
reason for democracy. (page 107)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Although all the rulers are to be philosophers, there are to be no
innovations: a philosopher is to be, for all time, a man who
understands and agrees with Plato. (page 115, on Plato's Utopia)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>... the fundamental question of ethics and politics, namely: Is
there any standard of “good” and “bad,” except what the man using
these words desires? (page 117)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>... any one who agrees with Thrasymachus will say: “There is no
question of proving or disproving; the only question is whether you
<em>like</em> the kind of State that Plato desires.” ... This is one of the
issues in philosophy that are still open; on each side there are men
who command respect. ... This problem is a difficult one, and I do
not profess to be able to solve it. (page 118)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>We may continue, if we like, to say that numbers are eternal,
immutable, and so on, but we must add that they are logical
fictions. (page 157)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Scepticism, as a doctrine of the schools, was first proclaimed by
Pyrrho, ... (page 233)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>The manner in which Arcesilaus taught would have had much to commend
it, if the young men who learnt from him had been able to avoid
being paralysed by it. He maintained no thesis, but would refute any
thesis set up by a pupil. Sometimes he would himself advance two
contradictory propositions on successive occasions, showing how to
argue convincingly in favour of either. ... So great was the
influence of Arcesilaus that the Academy remained sceptical for
about two hundred years. (pages 235-236)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>In the middle of this sceptical period, an amusing incident
occurred. Carneades, a worthy successor of Arcesilaus as head of the
Academy, was one of three philosophers sent by Athens on a
diplomatic mission to Rome in the year 156 B.C. He saw no reason why
his ambassadorial dignity should interfere with the main chance, so
he announced a course of lectures in Rome. The young men, who, at
that time, were anxious to ape Greek manners and acquire Greek
culture, flocked to hear him. His first lecture expounded the views
of Aristotle and Plato on justice, and was thoroughly edifying. His
second, however, was concerned in refuting all that he had said in
his first, not with a view of establishing opposite conclusions, but
merely to show that every conclusion is unwarranted. (page 236)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Without answering the arguments of the Sceptics, the ancient world
turned aside from them. (page 239)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Another doctrine of theirs [the Stoics] in theory of knowledge was
more influential, though more questionable. This was their belief in
innate ideas and principles. Greek logic was wholly deductive, and
this raised the question of first premises. First premises had to
be, at least in part, general, and no method existed of proving
them. The Stoics held that there are certain principles, which are
luminously obvious, and are admitted by all men; these could be
made, as in Euclid's <em>Elements,</em> the basis of deduction. Innate
ideas, similarly, could be used as the starting-point of
definitions. This point of view was accepted throughout the Middle
Ages, and even by Descartes. (page 269)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>... the most effective men of action are often intellectually
second-rate. (page 381)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Damian was the author of a treatise <em>On Divine Omnipotence,</em> which
maintained that God can do things contrary to the law of
contradiction, and can undo the past. (page 413)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems Russell has this one wrong; Damian <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/peter-damian/#GodRestVirg" title="Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Peter Damian">didn't say</a> quite that.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>In Hume, the empiricist philosophy culminated in a scepticism which
none could refute and none could accept. (page 494)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>The ancient world found an end to anarchy in the Roman Empire, but
the Roman Empire was a brute fact, not an idea. The Catholic world
sought an end to anarchy in the Church, which was an idea, but was
never adequately embodied in fact. Neither the ancient nor the
medieval solution was satisfactory—the one because it could not be
idealized, the other because it could not be actualized. The modern
world, at present, seems to be moving towards a solution like that
of antiquity: a social order imposed by force, representing the will
of the powerful rather than the hopes of common men. The problem of
a durable and satisfactory social order can only be solved by
combining the solidity of the Roman Empire with the idealism of
Saint Augustine's City of God. To achieve this a new philosophy will
be needed. (pages 494-495)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>The political conditions of the Renaissance favoured individual
development, but were unstable; the instability and the
individualism were closely connected, as in ancient Greece. A stable
social system is necessary, but every stable system hitherto devised
has hampered the development of exceptional artistic or intellectual
merit. How much murder and anarchy are we prepared to endure for the
sake of great achievements such as those of the Renaissance? In the
past, a great deal; in our own time, much less. No solution of this
problem has hitherto been found, although increase of social
organization is making it continually more important. (page 503)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>There are some respects in which the concepts of modern theoretical
physics differ from those of the Newtonian system. To begin with,
the conception of “force,” which is prominent in the seventeenth
centurey, has been found to be superfluous. “Force,” in Newton, is
the cause of change of motion, whether in magnitude or direction. To
notion of cause is regarded as important, and force is conceived
imaginatively as the sort of thing that we experience when we push
or pull. For this reason it was considered an objection to
gravitation that it acted at a distance, and Newton himself conceded
that there must be some medium by which is was transmitted.
Gradually it was found that all the equations could be written down
without bringing in forces. What was observable was a certain
relation between acceleration and configuration; to say that this
relationship was brought about by the intermediacy of “force” was to
add nothing to our knowledge. Observation shows that the planets
have at all times an acceleration towards the sun, which varies
inversely as the square of their distance from it. To say that this
is due to the “force” of gravitation is merely verbal, like saying
that opium makes people sleep because it has a dormitive virtue. The
modern physicist, therefore, merely states formulæ which determine
accelerations, and avoids the word “force” altogether. “Force” was
the faint ghost of the vitalist view as to the causes of motions,
and gradually the ghost has been exorcized. (page 539)</p>

<p>After five years spent in retirement, he [Francis Bacon] died of a
chill caught while experimenting on refrigeration by stuffing a
chicken full of snow. (page 542)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>One of the most famous parts of Bacon's philosophy is his
enumeration of what he calls “idols,” by which he means bad habits
of mind that cause people to fall into error. Of these he enumerates
five kinds. “Idos of the tribe” are those that are inherent in human
nature; he mentions in particular the habit of expecting more order
in natural phenomena than is actually to be found. “Idols of the
cave” are personal prejudices, characteristic of the particular
investigator. “Idols of the market-place” are those that have to do
with the tyranny of words and the difficulty of escaping from their
influence over our minds. “Idols of the theatre” are those that have
to do with received systems of thought; of these, naturally
Aristotle and the scholastics afforded him the most noteworthy
instances. Lastly there are “idols of the schools,” which consist in
thinking that some blind rule (such as the syllogism) can take the
place of judgement in investigation. (page 544)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this is interesting as compared to modern collections of
logical fallacies, like Almossawi's cute <a href="/20201012-bad_arguments_by_almossawi/">Bad Arguments</a>.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Bacon's inductive method is faulty through insufficient emphasis on
hypothesis. He hoped that mere orderly arrangement of data would
make the right hypothesis obvious, but this is seldom the case. As a
rule, the framing of a hypothesis is the most difficult part of
scientific work, and the part where great ability is indispensable.
So far, no method has been found which would make it possible to
invent hypotheses by rule. Usually some hypothesis is a necessary
preliminary to the collection of facts, since the selection of facts
demands some way of determining relevance. Without something of this
kind, the mere multiplicity of facts is baffling. (pages 544-545)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is related to modern thought around data science, data mining,
etc.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So long as national States exist and fight each other, only
inefficiency can preserve the human race. (page 557)</p>

<p>This is in relation to Hobbes's Leviathan...</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Therefore corporeal nature in general, involving such matters as
extension, magnitude, and number, is less easy to question than
beliefs about particular things. Arithmetic and geometry, which are
not concerned with particular things, are therefore more certain
than physics and astronomy; they are true even of dream objects,
which do not differ from real ones as regards number and extension.
Even in regard to arithmetic and geometry, however, doubt is
possible. It may be that God causes me to make mistakes whenever I
try to count the sides of a square or add 2 to 3. Perhaps it is
wrong, even in imagination, to attribute such unkindness to God, but
there might be an evil demon, no less cunning and deceitful than
powerful, employing all his industry in misleading me. If there be
such a demon, it may be that all the things I see are only illusions
of which he makes use as traps for my credulity. (pages 563-564)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>But these considerations have not disposed of the sceptical
arguments which threw doubt on the existence of the external world.
This can only be done by first proving the existence of God. (page

<p>Spinoza (1634-77) is the noblest and most lovable of the great
philosophers. Intellectually, some others have surpassed him, but
ethically he is supreme. (page 569)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[Arnauld had a negative opinion of some of the ideas Spinoza had
related in letters to Arnauld.] This hostile opinion no doubt led
Leibniz, thenceforth, to adopt a policy of secrecy as to his real
thoughts on philosophical subject. (page 591)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wonder how often this kind of thing has happened through history.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>There is a general belief (which I have never understood) that it is
better to exist than not to exist; on this ground children are
exhorted to be grateful to their parents. (page 594)</p>

<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>“For where is the man that has uncontestable evidence of the truth
of all that he holds, or of the falsehood of all he condemns; or can
say, that he has examined to the bottom all his own or other men's
opinions? The necessity of believing without knowledge, nay, often
upon very slight grounds, in this fleeting state of action and
blindness we are in, should make us more busy and careful to inform
ourselves than to restrain others. ... There is reason to think,
that if men were better instructed themselves, they would be less
imposing on others.” (page 609, quoting Locke)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Locke may be regarded as the founder of empiricism, which is the
doctrine that all our knowledge (with the possible exception of
logic and mathematics) is derived from experience. Accordingly the
first book of the <em>Essay</em> is concerned in arguing, as against Plato,
Descartes, and the scholastics, that there are no innate ideas or
principles. (page 609)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Empiricism and idealism alike are faced with a problem to which, so
far, philosophy has found no satisfactory solution. This is the
problem of showing how we have knowledge of other things than
ourself and the operations of our own mind. (page 611)</p>

<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>No one has yet succeeded in inventing a philosophy at once credible
and self-consistent. (page 613)</p>

<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Belief in the harmony between private and public interests is
characteristic of liberalism, and long survived the theological
foundation that it had in Locke.</p>
<p>Locke states that liberty depends upon the necessity of pursuing
true happiness and upon the government of our passions. This opinion
he derives from his doctrine that private and public interests are
identical in the long run, though not necessarily over short
periods.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I feel like there's a prisoner's dilemma in here.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>The hereditary principle has almost vanished from politics. During
my lifetime, the emperors of Brazil, China, Russia, Germany, and
Austria have disappeared, to be replaced by dictators who do not aim
at the foundation of a hereditary dynasty. Aristocracy has lost its
privileges throughout Europe, except in England, where they have
become little more than a historical form. All this, in most
countries, is very recent, and has much to do with the rise of
dictatorships, since the traditional basis of power has been swept
away, and the habits of mind required for the successful practice of
democracy have not had time to grow up. There is one great
institution that has never had any hereditary element, namely, the
Catholic Church. We may expect the dictatorships, if they survive,
to develop gradually a form of government analogous to that of the
Church. This has already happened in the case of the great
corporations in America, which have, or had until Pearl Harbor,
powers almost equal to those of the government. (pages 621-622)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>In Locke's theory of government, I repeat, there is little that is
original. In this Locke resembles most of the men who have won fame
for their ideas. As a rule, the man who first thinks of a new idea
is so much ahead of his time that every one thinks him silly, so
that he remains obscure and is soon forgotten. Then, gradually, the
world becomes ready for the idea, and the man who proclaims it at
the fortunate moment gets all the credit. So it was, for example,
with Darwin; poor Lord Monboddo was a laughing-stock. (page 624)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Monboddo was also a nudist, <a href="https://www.scottishlegal.com/articles/our-legal-heritage-lord-monboddo-the-nudist-judge-who-pre-empted-darwin-s-theory-of-evolution" title="Our Legal Heritage: Lord Monboddo – the nudist judge who pre-empted Darwin’s theory of evolution">apparently</a>?</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>[One view on the origin of government] maintained that God had
bestowed power on certain persons, and that these persons, or their
heirs, constituted the legitimate government, rebellion against
which is not only treason, but impiety. This view was sanctioned by
sentiments of immemorial antiquity: in almost all early
civilizations, the king is a sacred person. Kings, naturally,
considered it an admirable theory. Aristocracies had motives for
supporting it and motives for opposing it. In its favour was the
fact that it emphasized the hereditary principle, and that gave
august support to resistance against the upstart merchant class.
Where the middle class was more feared or hated by the aristocracy
than the king was, these motives prevailed. Where the contrary was
the case, and especially where the aristocracy had a chance of
obtaining supreme power itself, it tended to oppose the king, and
therefore to reject theories of divine right. (page 629)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is just a really good example of Russell's pragmatic, realpolitik
explanations: he frequently points out that people tend to believe
whatever tends to advantage them.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>The question of the rights of the individual as against the
government is a very difficult one. It is too readily assumed by
democrats that, when the government represents the majority, it has
a right to coerce the minority. Up to a point, this must be true,
since coercion is of the essence of government. But the divine right
of majorities, if pressed too far, may become almost as tyrannical
as the divine right of kings. (page 633)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Berkeley (Chapter XVI, starting page 647) is interesting for his focus
on perception. “<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/esse-est-percipi-doctrine" title="esse est percipi doctrine">esse est percipi</a>” It seems too strong to say that
we can know that things <em>don't</em> exist without being perceived though.
On what basis?</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>It remains to be asked whether any meaning can be attached to the
words “mind” and “matter.” Every one knows that “mind” is what an
idealist thinks there is nothing else but, and “matter” is what a
materialist thinks the same about. The reader knows also, I hope,
that idealists are virtuous and materialists are wicked. But perhaps
there may be more than this to be said.</p>
<p>My own definition of “matter” may seem unsatisfactory; I should
define it as what satisfies the equations of physics. There may be
nothing satisfying these equations; in that case either physics of
the concept “matter” is a mistake. If we reject substance, “matter”
will have to be a logical construction. Whether it can be any
construction composed of events—which may be partly inferred—is a
difficult question, but by no means an insoluble one.</p>
<p>As for “mind,” when substance has been rejected a mind must be some
group or structure of events. The grouping must be effected by some
relation which is characteristic of the sort of phenomena we wish to
call “mental.” We may take memory as typical. We might—though this
would be rather unduly simple—define a “mental” event as one which
remembers or is remembered. Then the “mind” to which a given mental
event belongs is the group of events connected with the given event
by memory-chains, backwards or forwards.</p>
<p>It will be seen that, according to the above definition, a mind and
a piece of matter are, each of them, a group of events. There is no
reason why every event should belong to a group of one kind or the
other, and there is no reason why some events should not belong to
both groups; therefore some events may be neither mental nor
material, and other events may be both. As to this, only detailed
empirical considerations can decide. (pages 658-659)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is about as nearly as Russell gives his own metaphysics. He has
some idea that “events” are fundamental. I don't see any clear reason
to think that his ideas here are good.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>In the Cartesian philosophy, as in that of the Scholastics, the
connection of cause and effect was supposed to be necessary, as
logical connections are necessary. The first really serious
challenge to this view came from Hume, with whom the modern
philosophy of causation begins. (page 664)</p>
<p>“We have no other notion of cause and effect, but that of certain
objects, which have been <em>always conjoined</em> together... We canot
penetrate into the reason of the conjunction.” (page 665, quoting
Hume)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>“All probable reasoning is nothing but a species of sensation. 'Tis
not solely in poetry and music, we must follow our taste and
sentiment, but likewise in philosophy. When I am convinced of any
principle, 'tis only an idea, which strikes more strongly upon me.
When I give the preference to one set of arguments above another, I
do nothing but decide from my feeling concerning the superiority of
their influence. Objects have no discoverable connexion together;
nor is it from any other principle but custom operating upon the
imagination, that we can draw any inference from the appearance of
one to the existence of another.” (page 670, quoting Hume)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The growth of unreason throughout the nineteenth century and what
has passed of the twentieth is a natural sequel to Hume's
destruction of empiricism. (page 673)</p>

<p>What these arguments [against induction] prove—and I do not think
the proof can be controverted—is that induction is an independent
logical principle, incapable of being inferred either from
experience or from other logical principles, and that without this
principle science is impossible. (page 674)</p>

<p>After satisfying himself that there is a God, the Vicar [Rousseau]
goes on to consider rules of conduct. “I do not deduce these rules,”
he says, “from the principles of a high philosophy, but I find them
in the depths of my heart, written by Nature in ineffaceable
characters.” From this he goes on to develop the view that
conscience is in all circumstances an infallible guide to right
action. “Thanks be to Heaven,” he concludes this part of his
argument, “we are thus freed from all this terrifying apparatus of
philosophy; we can be men without being learned; dispensed from
wasting our life in the study of morals, we have at less cost a more
assured guide in this immense labyrinth of human opinions.” Our
natural feelings, he contends, lead us to serve the common interest,
while our reason urges selfishness. We have therefore only to follow
feeling rather than reason in order to be virtuous. (page 693)</p>

<p>One of the bad effects of an anti-intellectual philosophy, such as
that of Bergson, is that it thrives upon the errors and confusions
of the intellect. Hence it is led to prefer bad thinking to good, to
declare every momentary difficulty insoluble, and to regard every
foolish mistake as revealing the bankruptcy of intellect and the
triumph of intuition. (page 803)</p>

<p>[William] James's doctrine of radical empiricism was first published
in 1904, in an <a href="http://fair-use.org/william-james/essays-in-radical-empiricism/does-consciousness-exist" title="Does Consciousness Exist? (1904)">essay</a> called “Does ‘Consciousness’ Exist?” The
main purpose of this essay was to deny that the subject-object
relation is fundamental. It had, until then, been taken for granted
by philosophers that there is a kind of occurrence called “knowing,”
in which one entity, the knower or subject, is aware of another, the
thing known or the object. The knower was regarded as a mind or
soul; the object known might be a material object, an eternal
essence, another mind, or, in self-consciousness, identical with the
knower. Almost everything in accepted philosophy was bound up with
the dualism of subject and object. The distinction of mind and
matter, the contemplative ideal, and the traditional notion of
“truth,” all need to be radically reconsidered if the distinction of
subject and object is not accepted as fundamental.</p>
<p>For my part, I am convinced that James was right on this matter, and
would, on this ground alone, deserve a high place among
philosophers. I had thought otherwise until he, and those who agreed
with him, persuaded me of the truth of his doctrine. But let us
proceed to his arguments. (page 812)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By the form of the words, radical empiricism's focus on pure
experience seems like it could be something I agree with. If
experience is central, and James is denying a material existence of
consciousness but not denying the state of being conscious, then maybe
it's just linguistic weirdness, and just my preference to say instead
that perhaps <em>only</em> consciousness exists. But the weirdness runs much
deeper.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My thesis is that if we start with the supposition that there is
only one primal stuff or material in the world, a stuff of which
everything is composed, and if we call that stuff pure experience,
then knowing can easily be explained as a particular sort of
relation towards one another into which portions of pure experience
may enter. (James's <a href="http://fair-use.org/william-james/essays-in-radical-empiricism/does-consciousness-exist" title="Does Consciousness Exist? (1904)">essay</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is as ridiculous as Leibniz's monads. What a jump! To claim you
can say what the whole universe is made of! To give it such a name!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That entity [consciousness] is fictitious, while thoughts in the
concrete are fully real. But thoughts in the concrete are made of
the same stuff as things are. (James's <a href="http://fair-use.org/william-james/essays-in-radical-empiricism/does-consciousness-exist" title="Does Consciousness Exist? (1904)">essay</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An underlying bad idea throughout, here, is that the physical world is
in a deep sense identical to our mental perception and ideas of the
physical world. I think this comes from the sense we have of directly
knowing the world around us, as when we see a cup, reach out and touch
it, and are assured of its existence as we expected. I would like to
get James a VR headset.</p>
<p>I guess this is where Russell gets his ideas about “events” that can
be combinations of mental and physical.</p>
<p>At least James doesn't deny conscious experience. Why he needs to go
all the way to a weird monism is beyond me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He defines “pure experience” as “the immediate flux of life which
furnishes the material to our later reflection.” (page 813, quoting
James's <em>Essays in Radical Empiricism</em>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The concept of “truth” as something dependent upon facts largely
outside human control has been one of the ways in which philosophy
hitherto has inculcated the necessary element of humility. When this
check upon pride is removed, a further step is taken on the road
towards a certain kind of madness—the intoxication of power which
invaded philosophy with Fichte, and to which modern men, whether
philosophers or not, are prone. I am persuaded that this
intoxication is the greatest danger of our time, and that any
philosophy which, however unintentionally, contributes to it is
increasing the danger of vast social disaster. (page 828)</p>

<p>Modern analytical empirical, of which I have been giving an outline,
differs from that of Locke, Berkeley, and Hume by its incorporation
of mathematics and its development of a powerful logical technique.
It is thus able, in regard to certain problems, to achieve definite
answers, which have the quality of science rather than of
philosophy. It has the advantage, as compared with the philosophies
of the system-builders, of being able to tackle its problems one at
a time, instead of having to invent at one stroke a block theory of
the whole universe. Its methods, in this respect, resemble those of
science. I have no doubt that, in so far as philosophical knowledge
is possible, it is by such methods that it must be sought; I have
also no doubt that, by these methods, many ancient problems are
completely soluble.</p>
<p>There remains, however, a vast field, traditionally included in
philosophy, where scientific methods are inadequate. This field
includes ultimate questions of value; science alone, for example,
cannot prove that it is bad to enjoy the infliction of cruelty.
Whatever can be known, can be known by means of science; but things
which are legitimately matters of feeling lie outside its province.</p>
<p>Philosophy, throughout its history, has consisted of two parts
inharmoniously blended: on the one hand a theory as to the nature of
the world, on the other an ethical or political doctrine as to the
best way of living. The failure to separate these two with
sufficient clarity has been a source of much confused thinking.
