   neither shall he eat.

   public wealth.
 * A high sense of public duty; intolerance of actions harmful to the
   public interest.

 * Honesty and truthfulness, moral purity, modesty, and
   unpretentiousness in social and private life.

   children.

   the freedom of nations.

The "Moral Code of the Builder of Communism" was part of the the 1961
[Third Program][] of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

> The core of the new approach to building communism was an attempt to
> replace Stalin's harsh administrative "pressure from above" with
> socialist self-government based on the principles of communist
> morality.

Thanks to [Nick Aristov][] for [pointing][] me to this! Here's the
relevant page from the [long PDF][] of the 1963 English translation,
from which I copied the Moral Code above. ([Wikipedia][] has slightly
different text somehow.)
