<h1>The Diamond Age, by Stephenson</h1>
<p class="date">Thursday April 22, 2021</p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.nealstephenson.com/the-diamond-age.html">novel</a> about an educational book invites comparison to its
subject. Stephenson's pedagogy walks you through Chekhov's armory,
dense with mental condensation nuclei, firing guns at the end but
maintaining ambiguity. Steam punk nanotech is backdrop for a My Fair
Lady story and revolution, with themes of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism">dualism</a> and generally
flawed humans.</p>
<p><img alt="cover" src="cover.jpg" /></p>
<h3>Economics and technology</h3>
<p>I read Diamond Age because it was mentioned in <a href="https://planspace.org/20210401-trekonomics_by_saadia/">Trekonomics</a>. They
have a technology like a replicator, but it doesn't really feel like a
post-scarcity world because its use is centrally controlled/limited.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"... the Feed is not a system of control and oppression, as CryptNet
would maintain. It is the only way order can be maintained in modern
society—if everyone possessed a Seed, anyone could produce weapons
whose destructive power rivalled that of Elizabethan nuclear
weapons." (page 384, Hackworth speaking unconvincingly)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Seed, never quite achieved in the book, is a nanotech magic bean
that promises to usher in a decentralized post-scarcity world, like
farming communes where you can grow anything effortlessly, biological
or mechanical. Its creation is opposed by the less obviously
destructive factions based on fear of loss of control.</p>
<p>Some of the rich and powerful are referred to as "Equity Lords," which
is an interesting title, especially in relation to modern tech
companies where people have equity to varying degrees, or more
generally in connection with people who own stock in the markets.</p>
<h3>Anti-relativism</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"Finkle-McGraw began to develop an opinion that was to shape his
political views in later years, namely, that while people were not
<em>genetically</em> different, they were <em>culturally</em> as different as they
could possibly be, and that some cultures were simply better than
others. This was not a subjective value judgment, merely an
observation that some cultures thrived and expanded while others
failed. It was a view implicitly shared by nearly everyone but, in
those days, never voiced." (pages 20-21)</p>
<p>"[Nell's mother] didn't like craftsmen, she said, because they were
too much like actual Victorians, always spouting all kinds of crap
about how one thing was better than another thing, which eventually
led, she explained, to the belief that some people were better than
others." (page 185)</p>
<p>"it is upon moral qualities that a society is ultimately founded.
All the prosperity and technological sophistication in the world is
of no use without that foundation—we learned this in the late
twentieth century, when it became unfashionable to teach these
things." (page 322, Miss Matheson speaking)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The "Neo-Victorian" group is largely a reaction to techno-hedonism. It
reminds me of how it can seem these days that wealthier people are
more likely to choose old-fashioned wooden toys and the like for their
children, more likely to avoid screen time.</p>
<p>In the extreme, I think this kind of view takes a form like
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Absolute-Relativism-Dictatorship-What-about/dp/1933919469">Absolute Relativism: The New Dictatorship</a>.</p>
<h3>Rugged individualism</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"Grandfather loved to tell stories of these criminals, how they had
tried to excuse their own crimes by pleading that they were
economically disadvantaged or infected with the disease of substance
abuse, and how the Lone Eagles—many of whom had overcome poverty or
addiction themselves—had dispatched them with firing squads and left
them posted around the edge of their territory as NO TRESPASSING
signs that even the illiterate could read." (pages 405-406)</p>
<p>"... the usual crowd of starving peasants and professional amputees"
(page 449)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For one thing, it's pretty clearly not a post-scarcity society. For
another, it's not very shy about seeming to blame people for not doing
better for themselves despite this.</p>
<h3>Tribalism</h3>
<p>There's a lot of tribalism, much of it racial/racist. I think the
reasoning was that with the dissolution of traditional governments,
people needed to form their own equivalents more than they previously
did, but this wasn't super clear to me.</p>
<p>The major conflict, which develops mostly in the background until the
end of the book, is a second <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxer_Rebellion">Boxer Rebellion</a>.</p>
<p>It's not clear whether the ends justify the means, but there's at
least a chance the Seed could be a good idea. Would tribalism recede
in a true post-scarcity environment?</p>
<h3>Dualism</h3>
<p>Nanotechnology represents the material, physical world.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"But [Hackworth, the nanotech engineer] had felt the need to go
beyond that—he had wanted to reach beyond mere matter and into
someone's soul." (page 188)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mercifully, there's no mention of quantum mechanics to introduce false
confusion. The technology is very physical in the classical sense;
nanotech computers use "rod logic" to achieve their results. With the
Neo-Victorians, it contributes to a steam punk vibe.</p>
<p>The discussion of dualism is extended to computing, with a substantial
exploration of Turing machines.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"... a Turing machine, no matter how complex, was not human. It had
no soul. It could not do what a human did." (page 442)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's also no mention of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercomputation">hypercomputation</a>... An amusing thought:
is hypercomputation fundamentally dualist (implying non-physical
phenomena)?</p>
<h3>Education</h3>
<p>I'm interested in educational technology. It's largely <a href="/20201028-failure_to_disrupt_by_reich/">failed</a> to
revolutionize education so far, but many like <a href="https://moores.samaltman.com/">Altman</a> hold out hope
for "AI teachers that can diagnose and explain exactly what a student
doesn’t understand" and the like.</p>
<p>What is the goal of education? The instigator of the creation of the
AI teaching books says he wants to encourage subversion, but he also
thinks the effect of this will be creating people who tend to agree
with him.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"You encourage subversiveness because you think that it will have an
effect opposite to what one might naively suppose." (page 365, Carl
Hollywood addressing Finkle-McGraw)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of the girls who get the three "original" books with voices done by
remote human voice actors, one girl becomes an actor in a strange
troupe, one joins a faction opposed to that of Finkle-McGraw (though
he thinks she'll return eventually), and one works scripts at a
specialist brothel and then eventually stymies (at least briefly) a
revolution that threatens a person she loves. Is this successful
education? Maybe?</p>
<p>There are also hundreds of thousands of girls who were raised by books
with computer-generated voices. Their books were also further modified
by Hackworth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"At this point, John Percival Hackworth, almost without thinking
about it and without appreciating the ramifications of what he was
doing, devised a trick and slipped it in under the radar of the
Judge and Dr. X and all of the other people in the theatre, who were
better at noticing tricks than most other people in the world.
"While I'm at it, if it pleases the court, I can also," Hackworth
said, most obsequiously, "make changes in the content so that it
will be more suitable for the unique cultural requirements of the
Han readership."" (page 180)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Everybody who gets the Chinese-language version of the Primer goes on
to form the "mouse army" that serves Nell for unclear reasons toward
the end of the book.</p>
<p>Diamond Age definitely suggests that valuable aspects of human
development work best (or only) through human interaction. Multiple
times the importance of culture generally is emphasized. The AI book
is not necessarily any more enlightened than other kinds of education.
Maybe it can stand in for ed tech that is just a computerized version
of antique methods, despite all its customization.</p>
<p>There are other comments about education, but Stephenson sometimes
seems to be effectively free-associating, suggesting different aspects
to connect and consider.</p>

<h3>More selected quotes</h3>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"By nature, men are nearly alike; by practice, they get to be wide
apart." (epigraph, quoting <a href="https://china.usc.edu/confucius-analects-17">Confucius</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"A sizable investment, but the best a father could make." (page 78,
referring to education)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"... Nell knew better than to fret over things she could not
change." (page 123)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Primer seems to have helped make Nell a <a href="/20210107-enchiridion_in_52_sentences/">stoic</a>.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"If the Coastal Republic had believed in the <em>existence</em> of virtue,
it could at least have aspired to hypocrisy." (page 144)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"He is worth a thousand lesser engineers." (page 170, Dr. X
referring to Hackworth)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>On page 184, the Primer is described as "a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaedeutics">Propædeutic</a>
Enchiridion."</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"She often put it under her pillow, though, and sometimes she even
woke up in the middle of the night and heard it whispering things to
her that she had just been dreaming about." (page 184)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This seems to imply that the Primer employed some kinds of
subconscious programming techniques...</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"But I think it is not likely to be the only instance in which real
life turns out to be more complicated than what you have seen in the
book." (page 281, Constable Moore speaking)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>""Nell," the Constable continued, indicating through his tone of
voice that the lesson was concluding, "the difference between
ignorant people and educated people is that the latter know more
facts. But that has nothing to do with whether they are stupid or
intelligent. The difference between stupid and intelligent
people—and this is true whether or not they are well-educated—is
that intelligent people can handle subtlety. They are not baffled by
ambiguous or even contradictory situations—in fact, they expect them
and are apt to become suspicious when things seem overly
straightforward.</p>
<p>"In your Primer you have a resource that will make you highly
educated, but it will never make you intelligent. That comes from
life. Your life up to this point has given you all of the experience
you need to be intelligent, but you have to think about those
experiences. If you don't think about them, you'll be
psychologically unwell. If you do think about them, you will become
not merely educated but intelligent" (page 283)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"She appears to be learning new material that isn't explicitly
covered in the Primer, and she's developing more sophisticated forms
of social interaction, suggesting that she's spending more time
around a higher class of people." (pages 284-285, Miranda speaking)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"And there was an ocean of history to be learned: first biblical,
Greek, and Roman, and then the history of many other peoples around
the world that essentially served as backdrop for History of the
English-Speaking Peoples." (page 312, describing the stodgy school)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Miss Stricken handled the big payoff at the end of each period and
at the end of each unit. She stormed in to explain what conclusion
they were being led to and to make sure that all of them got it."
(page 313)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"She was tormented by the irrationality of this place." (page 319,
referring to the stodgy school)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Now, there was a time when we believed that what a human mind could
accomplish was determined by genetic factors. Piffle, of course, but
it looked convincing for many years, because distinctions between
tribes were so evident. Now we understand that it's all cultural.
That, after all, is what a culture is—a group of poeple who share in
common certain acquired traits." (page 321, Miss Matheson speaking)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"It is the hardest thing in the world to make educated Westerners
pull together," Miss Matheson went on. "That is the job of people
like Miss Stricken. We must forgive them their imperfections. She is
like an avatar—do you children know about avatars? She is the
physical embodiment of a principle. That principle is that outside
the comfortable and well-defended borders of our phyle is a hard
world that will come and hurt us if we are not careful. It is not an
easy job to have. We must all feel sorry for Miss Stricken." (page
323)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>On pages 353 and 354 Miss Matheson goes on about how Nell is special.
"You are different." and so on. Are we supposed to believe her, or is
this just an aspect of the stodgy school weirdness? Other aspects of
the book don't seem aligned with Great Man thinking.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>""Which path do you intend to take, Nell?" said the Constable,
sounding very interested. "Conformity or rebellion?""</p>
<p>""Neither one. Both ways are simple-minded—they are only for people
who cannot cope with contradiction and ambiguity."" (page 356)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She goes to seek her fortune as a writer for a particularly involved
brothel.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>""... [Miranda] was not merely Nell's tutor. She became Nell's
mother."" (page 357, Carl Hollywood speaking)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>""In a tribe such as the F.D.R. [First Distributed Republic], whose
view of the universe contains no absolutes, this ritual
[elaborate trust-falls] creates an artificial absolute."" (page 378,
Hackworth explaining)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>On page 383 there's a "thirty-third level" which seems like a
throwaway reference to Masonry...</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"... Princess Nell had become so beautiful over the years and had
developed such a fine bearing that few people would mistake her for
a commoner now, even if she were dressed in rags and walking
barefoot."</p>
<p>"... Nell wondered at that. Princesses were not genetically
different from commoners." (page 386)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"learning the language, which was extremely pithy and made heavy use
of parentheses."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some Lisp? Cute reference.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Her stories were being digested, not by the Primer, but by another
human being, becoming a part of that person's mind." (pages 402-403)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"But the Primer was, itself, a Turing machine, or so she suspected;
so how could it understand Nell?"</p>
<p>"Could it be that the Primer was just a conduit, a technological
system that mediated between Nell and some human being who really
loved her?" (page 403)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Miranda provides the voicing for whatever the Primer wants to say.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>""Belief isn't a binary state, not here at least. Does anyone
believe anything one hundred percent?"" (page 425)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>""Society has never been good at answering these questions—the sorts
of questions you can't just look up in a reference database."" (page
428)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"But the human mind didn't work like a digital computer and was
capable of doing some funny things." (page 433)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"It would be more correct to say that, although it was virtuous to
save them, it was mistaken to believe that they could be raised
properly. We lacked the resources to raise them individually, and so
we raised them with books. But the only proper way to raise a child
is within a family. The Master <a href="https://china.usc.edu/confucius-analects-17">Confucius</a> could have told us as
much, had we listened to his words." (page 455, Dr. X speaking)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"... all of Nell's intellect, her vast knowledge and skills,
accumulated over a lifetime of intensive training, meant nothing at
all when she was confronted with a handful of organized peasants."
(page 469)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"all of the societies that had grown up around the concept of a
centralized, hierarchical Feed." (page 498)</p>
