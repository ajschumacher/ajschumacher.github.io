# System Design Interview, by Xu

I hadn't done system design interviews before last summer when I
interviewed at Google, Uber, Facebook, Robinhood, and a few others.
Alex Xu's [insider's guide][] became one of my main prep materials for
this interview type. I think it helped.

I was preparing for system design interviews for machine learning
engineering positions, and sort of related design questions on ML for
data science positions. Xu's book is on more general software
engineering, but I thought it was still interesting and valuable. MLE
interviews can have "regular" SWE system design components too. For
system design content more specific to machine learning, I thought
[Educative][] had some decent materials.

I think system design interviews are often trying to evaluate not just
abstract or academic knowledge, but experience, thinking, and
communication skills. Reading a book like this helps jumpstart and
review your knowledge, and is definitely valuable, but is probably not
sufficient for a truly outstanding performance. So you could start
here, but don't stop!
