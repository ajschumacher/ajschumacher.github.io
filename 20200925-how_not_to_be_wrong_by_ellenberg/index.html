<h1>How Not to Be Wrong, by Ellenberg</h1>
<p class="date">Friday September 25, 2020</p>
<p>I like <a href="https://www.jordanellenberg.com/how-not-to-be-wrong/">this book</a> a lot. The five parts (Linearity, Inference,
Expectation, Regression, Existence) provide beautiful large-scale
structure, and it also shimmers on every page. Supreme Court justices
encounter the word "orthogonal." There's a beautiful proof of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffon%27s_needle_problem">Buffon's needle problem</a>. There's some philosophy of math.
Ellenberg is a delight.</p>
<p>In some ways, How Not to Be Wrong is like a long version of
<a href="/20200909-mathematicians_lament_by_lockhart/">Lockhart's exultation</a>, with examples. Lockhart extols the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_exhaustion">method of exhaustion</a>; Ellenberg teaches it. The author clearly
loves math, and shares it generously with the reader.</p>
<p>The "How Not to Be Wrong" is delivered by exposing numerous common
fallacies or errors in understanding. Not every phenomenon is linear.
"Don't talk about percentages of numbers when the numbers might be
negative." "Improbable things happen a lot," and that affects how you
should think about significance tests and related things. The book is
a joy to read, I'd also read a "handbook" version collecting just the
main ideas.</p>

<p>"Those [homework] integrals are to mathematics as weight training

<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Mathematicians like to give names to the phenomena our common sense
describes: instead of saying “<em>This</em> thing added to <em>that</em> thing is
the <em>same</em> thing as <em>that</em> thing added to <em>this</em> thing,” we say
“Addition is commutative.”" (page 11)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"We tend to teach mathematics as a long list of rules. You learn
them in order and you have to obey them, because if you don’t obey
them you get a C-. <em>This is not mathematics.</em> Mathematics is the
study of things that come out a certain way because there is no
other way they could possibly be." (page 12)</p>

<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"The specialized language in which mathematicians converse with one
another is a magnificent tool for conveying complex ideas precisely
and swiftly. But its foreignness can create among outsiders the
impression of a sphere of thought totally alien to ordinary
thinking. That's exactly wrong." (page 12)</p>

<p>"Mathematics is the extension of common sense by other means." (page

<p>"(Aside: it's important to point out here that people with
out-of-the-mainstream ideas who compare themselves to Edison and
Galileo are <em>never actually right</em>. I get letters with this kind of
language at least once a month, usually from people who have
“proofs” of mathematical statements that have been known for
hundreds of years to be false. I can guarantee you Einstein did not
go around telling people, “Look, I know this theory of general
relativity sounds wacky, but that's what they said about Galileo!”)"

<blockquote>
<p>"Working an integral or performing a linear regression is something
a computer can do quite effectively. Understanding whether the
result makes sense—or deciding whether the method is the right one
to use in the first place—requires a guiding human hand. When we
teach mathematics we are supposed to be explaining how to be that
guide. A math course that fails to do so is essentially training the
student to be a very slow, buggy version of Microsoft Excel." (page

<blockquote>
<p>"there are algorithms I think we can safely discard in the modern
world. We don't need to teach students how to extract square roots

<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Of course it's no better (in fact, it's substantially worse) to
pass along a population of students who've developed some wispy
sense of mathematical meaning but can't work examples swiftly and
correctly. A math teacher's least favorite thing to hear from a
student is “I get the concept, but I couldn't do the problems.”
Though the student doesn't know it, this is shorthand for “I don't
get the concept.” The ideas of mathematics can sound abstract, but
they make sense only in reference to concrete computations. William
Carlos Williams put it crisply: <em>no ideas but in things</em>." (page 58)</p>

<p>"If a tiny state like South Dakota experiences a rash of brain
cancer, you might presume that the spike is in large measure due to
luck, and you might estimate that the rate of brain cancer in the
future is likely to be closer to the overall national number. You
could accomplish this by taking some kind of weighted average of the
South Dakota rate with the national rate. But how to weight the two
numbers? That's a bit of an art, involving a fair amount of
technical labor I'll spare you here." (pages 70-71)</p>

<p>I think he's referring to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilevel_model">multi-level modeling</a>, in the Gelman

<p>"When we are scientists, or Torah scholars, or toddlers gaping at
the clouds, we are presented with <em>observations</em> and asked to build
<em>theories</em>–what went into the box to produce the world that we see?
Inference is a hard thing, maybe the hardest thing." (page 110)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ellenberg says "inference" but I might say "abduction."</p>
<hr />
<p>Dangers of comparing very small rates:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"... <em>twice a tiny number is a tiny number</em>. How good or bad it is
to double something depends on how big that something is!" (page
120)</p>
<p>"Risk ratios are much easier for the brain to grasp than tiny
splinters of probability like 1 in 7,000. But risk ratios applied to
small probabilities can easily mislead you." (page 120)</p>

<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"The truth is, the null hypothesis, if we take it literally, is
probably just about always false." (page 120)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"If only we could go back in time to the dawn of statistical
nomenclature and declare that a result passing Fisher's test with a
p-value of less than 0.05 was “statistically noticeable” or
“statistically detectable” instead of “statistically significant”!
That would be truer to the meaning of the method, which merely
counsels us about the existence of an effect but is silent about its
size or importance. But it's too late for that. We have the language
we have." (page 121)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"It has come to my attention that hardly anybody knows what the
logarithm is. Let me take a step toward fixing this. The logarithm
of a positive number <em>N</em>, called <em>log N</em>, is the number of digits it
has." (page 139)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He goes on to call this the "fake logarithm," of "flogarithm."</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"In particular, the view that the primary concern of statistics is
making decisions is more closely associated with Neyman than with
Pearson." (page 159)</p>

<p>Reminds me of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassie_Kozyrkov">Cassie Kozyrkov</a>, the Google Decision Scientist.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The p-value is the answer to the question</p>
<p>""The chance that the observed experimental result would occur,
given that the null hypothesis is correct."</p>
<p>"But what we <em>want</em> to know is the other conditional probability:</p>
<p>""The chance that the null hypothesis is correct, given that we
observed a certain experimental result."" (page 170)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is connected to Bayesian stats as "inverse probability", and he
also notes that it's referred to as "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor%27s_fallacy">the prosecutor's fallacy</a>" and
references the book <em>Math on Trial</em>.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"no scientific worker has a fixed level of significance at which
from year to year, and in all circumstances, he rejects hypotheses;
he rather gives his mind to each particular case in the light of his
evidence and his ideas" (page 180, quoting Fisher)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Saying that even Fisher thinks our prior beliefs enter our work;
Fisher just has certain ideas about when it's appropriate to invoke
probability: he insists on some actual chance process.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"We tend to like simpler theories better than more complicated ones;
theories that rest on analogies to things we already know about
better than theories that posit totally novel phenomena." (page 182)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"... you have to be careful about the universe of theories you
consider. Just as there may be more than one solution to a quadratic
equation, there may be multiple theories that give rise to the same
observation, and if we don't consider them all, our inferences may
lead us badly astray." (page 185)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the
impossible, whatever remains, however improbably, must be the truth,
unless the truth is a hypothesis it didn't occur to me to consider."
(page 188)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"And as much as I love Bayesian inference, I think people are
probably best off arriving at their faith, or discarding it, in a
non-quantitative way." (page 191)</p>

<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Expected value is not the value you expect" (page 198)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/pdf/upload_library/22/Ford/Abrams2011.pdf">Finding Good Bets in the Lottery, and Why You Shouldn’t Take Them</a> is a great reference, which I connect to my <a href="/2012/06/04/expected-value-is-not-useful-for-making/">Expected value is not useful for making decisions about lottery tickets</a>.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Any given ticket is probably worthless, but if you've got a
thousand tickets, it's essentially certain that you'll make your
money back and then some." (page 209)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This gets at what I think is important: It isn't the expected value
you care about, it's your probability of being in a state that doesn't
suck. You want P(losing money) to become negligible, and that can
happen if you have positive expected value <em>and</em> enough tickets.</p>
<hr />

<p>The doctrine of expected utility is appealingly straightforward and
simple: presented with a set of choices, pick the one with the
highest expected utility. It is perhaps the closest thing we have to
a simple mathematical theory of individual decision making. And it
captures many features of the way humans make choices, which is why
it remains a central part of the quantitative social scientist's
tool kit. (page 248)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"In the decision-theory literature, the former kind of unknown is
called <em>risk</em>, the latter <em>uncertainty</em>." (page 251)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The former is known unknowns (30% chance of drawing a black ball) and
the latter is unknown unknowns (maybe we're wrong about what the
chance is).</p>

we make the numbers small enough that we can draw pictures." (page

<p>"The Patent Department would not release the thing until they had
patent coverage. ... I didn't believe that they could patent a bunch
of mathematical formulas. I said they couldn't. They said, "Watch

weak understanding of patent laws because, regularly, things that
you shouldn't be able to patent–it's outrageous–you can patent."

<p>"You have made a convert of an opponent in one sense, for I have
always maintained that excepting fools, men did not differ much in
intellect, only in zeal and hard work; and I still think this is an
eminently important difference." (page 300, quoting Charles Darwin's
letter to his cousin Francis Galton on the effect of reading
Galton's "Hereditary Genius")</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Ellenberg includes a fun table of Galton's on page 316, which has the
character of a visualization in that you can see an ellipse, sort of
like a two-dimensional stem and leaf plot...</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_anthropometry#Forensic_anthropometry">Bertillonage</a> (page 325) is kind of interesting and can be related

<p>"A democracy cannot endure unless it be composed of able citizens;
therefore it must in self-defence withstand the free introduction of
degenerate stock." (page 335, quoting Galton)</p>
<p>"There is real danger that, by strengthening our abilities to
analyze some questions mathematically, we acquire a general
confidence in our beliefs, which extends unjustifiably to those
things we're still wrong about." (page 335)</p>

<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Darwin showed that one could meaningfully talk about progress
without any need to invoke purpose. Galton showed that one could
meaningfully talk about association without any need to invoke
underlying cause." (page 336)</p>

<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Mathematicians ever since Descartes have enjoyed the wonderful
freedom to flip back and forth between algebraic and geometric
descriptions of the world. The advantage of algebra is that it's
easier to formalize and to type into a computer. The advantage of
geometry is that it allows us to bring our physical intuition to
bear on the situation, particularly when you can draw a picture. I
seldom feel I <em>really</em> understand a piece of mathematics until I
know what it's about in geometric language." (page 336)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This relates to "The Rule of Three" in the McCallum et al. <em>Multivariable Calculus</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Every topic should be presented geometrically, numerically and
algebraically." (page v)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"It may sound impressive that we can do geometry in ten dimensions
(or a hundred, or a million...), but the mental pictures we keep in
our mind are two- or at most three-dimensional. That's all our
brains can handle. Fortunately, this impoverished vision is usually
enough." (page 338)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Correlation is not transitive. It's more like "blood relation"–I'm
related to my son, who's related to my wife, but my wife and I
aren't blood relatives to each other. In fact, it's not a terrible
idea to think of correlated variables as "sharing part of their
DNA."" (page 342)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Undecided voters, by and large, aren't undecided because they're
carefully weighing the merits of each candidate, unprejudiced by
political dogma. They're undecided because they're barely paying
attention." (page 346)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>A section titled "It's not always wrong to be wrong" on page 354
suggests decision-making by expected value can be appropriate even if
it turns out later that a risk isn't as previously believed.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"There is no such thing as public opinion" (page 365)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"The "majority rules" system is simple and elegant and feels fair,
but it's at its best when deciding between just two options. Any
more than two, and contradictions start to seep into the majority's
preferences." (page 368)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ellenberg's immediate (and real, October 2010) example:</p>
<ul>
<li>52% oppose ACA</li>
<li>41% support ACA</li>
</ul>
<p>But:</p>
<ul>
<li>37% favor repeal of ACA</li>
<li>10% favor weakening ACA</li>
<li>15% favor maintaining ACA</li>
<li>36% favor expanding ACA</li>
</ul>
<p>This implies that some of the "oppose" people oppose it because they
want <em>more extreme</em> policy than ACA, not less.</p>

</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"This is a story told in mathematics again and again: we develop a
method that works for one problem, and if it is a <em>good</em> method, one
that really contains a new idea, we typically find that the same
proof works in many different contexts, which may be as different
from the original as a sphere is from a plane, or more so." (page
399)</p>

<hr />
<p>Describes formalism as being the tradition of definition; thinking
about what "1 - 1 + 1 -1 + ..." should be <em>defined as</em>, rather that
what it <em>is</em>. This can have the effect of replacing <em>meaning</em> with
definition.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"If we're to be precise, Russell was not a formalist, like Hilbert,
who declared that the axioms were just strings of symbols with no
defined meaning; rather, he was a "logicist," whose view was that
the axioms were actually true statements about logical facts. Both
groups shared a vigorous interest in figuring out which statements
could be deduced from the axioms. The extent to which you care about
this distinction is a good measure of whether you would enjoy going
to graduate school in analytic philosophy." (page 409)</p>

<p>"Political logic is not a formal system in the sense that Hilbert
and the mathematical logicians meant, but mathematicians with a
formalist outlook couldn't help but approach politics with the same
kind of methodological sympathies. They were encouraged in this by
Hilbert himself, who in his 1918 lecture "<a href="/20200923-axiomatic_thinking_hilbert_1918/">Axiomatic Thought</a>"
advocated that the other sciences adopt the axiomatic approach that
had been so successful in mathematics."</p>

<p>"[F. Scott Fitzgerald's] endorsement of holding contradictory
beliefs ["the test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to
hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still
retain the ability to function"] comes from "The Crack-Up," his
1936 essay about his own irreparable brokenness. The opposing ideas
he has in mind there are "the sense of futility of effort and the
