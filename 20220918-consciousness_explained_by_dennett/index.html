<h1>Consciousness Explained, by Dennett</h1>
<p class="date">Sunday September 18, 2022</p>
<p>Dennett takes materialism as an axiom and uses it to prove there is no
dualist, soul-like consciousness, no audience in a “Cartesian
theater.” He thinks that if you imagine a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_zombie">philosophical zombie</a>,
then you're imagining too hard, and if you don't think the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room">Chinese room</a> is conscious, then you aren't imagining hard enough.
His argument is that the brain must be where consciousness comes from,
and we know what kind of things are in the brain, so consciousness
must be from all that: lots of simple things together generate
consciousness and there's nothing more to the story. I don't feel like
it's explained.</p>
<p>Do I ask too much of an explanation of consciousness? Science is
fundamentally descriptive, after all. Maxwell's equations (etc.) don't
explain <em>why</em> electromagnetism (etc.) is the way it is. They don't
really explain <em>how</em> it works. Every theory is vulnerable to a child
repeatedly asking “why.” This is the kind of infinite regress Dennett
is trying to avoid. And yet, I am conscious. This <em>experience</em> is the
phenomenon of interest. Being able to <em>have</em> experiences. I don't
think there's anything being a magnet is like, but there is something
being me is like, and I'm not convinced Dennett explains the
difference.</p>
<p>It seems very much like a riff on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_Mind">Society of Mind</a>, which I should
probably read as well, though I don't know whether it will be more
persuasive. Do people consider this a settled issue? At least in the
popular press, folks are still <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.co.za/science/quantum-physics-could-finally-explain-consciousness-scientists-say/" title="Quantum Physics Could Finally Explain Consciousness, Scientists Say">pitching</a> weird ideas and describing
consciousness as a “deep and abiding philosophical problem.” Is
Dennett's explanation bad, or do I just not want to understand?</p>
<p>For the most part, I think Dennett is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_even_wrong">not even wrong</a>, because he
isn't explaining what he promises to. It is a challenge, though, to
imagine what explanation (between Dennett and dualism) I would prefer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"One conclusion we can draw from this is that we are not brains in
vats—in case you were worried." (page 7)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He's arguing this is the case because it would be too computationally
expensive to simulate a world, based on the graphics of Donkey Kong
being crummy. Perhaps this seemed convincing in 1991?</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"And, as with all the earlier mysteries, there are many who
insist—and hope—that there will never be a demystification of
consciousness." (page 22)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I do have some sympathy for this critique... What <em>would</em> a
satisfactory explanation look like?</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"The challenge is to construct a theory of mental events, using the
data that scientific method permits. Such a theory will have to be
constructed from the third-person point of view, since all science
is constructed from that perspective." (page 71)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Suppose you are confronted by a “speaking” computer, and suppose
you succeed in interpreting its output as speech acts expressing its
beliefs and opinions, presumably “about” its conscious states. The
fact that there is a single, coherent interpretation of a sequence
of behavior doesn’t establish that the interpretation is true; it
might be only as if the “subject” were conscious; we risk being
taken in by a zombie with no inner life at all. You could not
confirm that the computer was conscious of anything by this method
of interpretation. Fair enough. We can’t be sure that the speech
acts we observe express real beliefs about actual experiences;
perhaps they express only apparent beliefs about nonexistent
experiences. Still, the fact that we had found even one stable
interpretation of some entity’s behavior as speech acts would always
be a fact worthy of attention." (page 78)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you agree with Dennett, then do you agree that Google's
<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/google-engineer-claims-ai-chatbot-is-sentient-why-that-matters/" title="Google Engineer Claims AI Chatbot Is Sentient: Why That Matters">LaMDA is conscious</a>? According to Dennett, it might as well be, and
he doesn't identify any method for distinguishing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Other people, however, find the implication that there could be, in
principle, a conscious robot so incredible that it amounts in their
eyes to the reductio ad absurdum of my theory." (page 432)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"the famous four F’s (fight, flee, feed, or mate)" (page 188)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hadn't heard this one before.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Here is the hypothesis I will defend: Human consciousness is itself
a huge complex of memes (or more exactly, meme-effects in brains)
that can best be understood as the operation of a “von Neumannesque”
virtual machine implemented in the parallel architecture of a brain
that was not designed for any such activities. The powers of this
virtual machine vastly enhance the underlying powers of the organic
hardware on which it runs, but at the same time many of its most
curious features, and especially its limitations, can be explained
as the byproducts of the kludges that make possible this curious but
effective reuse of an existing organ for novel purposes." (page 210)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"But still (I am sure you want to object): All this has little or
nothing to do with consciousness! After all, a von Neumann machine
is entirely unconscious; why should implementing it—or something
like it: a Joycean machine—be any more conscious? I do have an
answer: The von Neumann machine, by being wired up from the outset
that way, with maximally efficient informational links, didn’t have
to become the object of its own elaborate perceptual systems. The
workings of the Joycean machine, on the other hand, are just as
“visible” and “audible” to it as any of the things in the external
world that it is designed to perceive—for the simple reason that
they have much of the same perceptual machinery focused on them. Now
this appears to be a trick with mirrors, I know." (page 225)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"With so many idiots working on the problem, no wonder consciousness
is still a mystery." (page 255)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Out of context, yes.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"There seems to be phenomenology. That’s a fact that the
heterophenomenologist enthusiastically concedes. But it does not
follow from this undeniable, universally attested fact that there
really is phenomenology." (page 366)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"It is time to recognize the idea of the possibility of zombies for
what it is: not a serious philosophical idea but a preposterous and
ignoble relic of ancient prejudices. Maybe women aren’t really
conscious! Maybe Jews! What pernicious nonsense." (page 405)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This protest is a little weird, given that earlier Dennett defines
"people" as "adult human beings" (not children?) and argues that
consciousness is largely a cultural phenomenon (so one culture could
be more conscious than another?).</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"It is hard to imagine how “just more of the same” could add up to
understanding, but we have very good reason to believe that it does,
so in this case, we should try harder, not give up." (page 439)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dennett implicitly rejects the possibility that there could be
something different, something not just more of the same, something
that is an explanation of consciousness rather than a rejection of a
dualist explanation.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"(What could a clam do with a secret? Just sit there in the mud,
chuckling to itself?)" (page 447)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is really funny to me somehow. What a happy clam!</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"the assumption that consciousness is a special all-or-nothing
property that sunders the universe into two vastly different
categories: the things that have it (the things that it is like
something to be, as Nagel would put it) and the things that lack
it." (page 447)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree that this is weird too.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"When a deaf-mute acquires language (in particular, Sign language,
the most natural language a deaf-mute can learn), a full-fledged
human mind is born, clearly different in discoverable ways from the
mind of a hearing person, but capable of all the reflective
intricacy and generative power—perhaps more."</p>
<p>"But without a natural language, a deaf-mute’s mind is terribly
stunted."</p>
<p>"Many people are afraid to see consciousness explained because they
fear that if we succeed in explaining it, we will lose our moral
bearings. Maybe we can imagine a conscious computer (or the
consciousness of a bat) but we shouldn’t try, they think. If we get
into that bad habit, we will start treating animals as if they were
wind-up toys, babies and deaf-mutes as if they were teddy bears,
and—just to add insult to injury—robots as if they were real
people."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(page 448)</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Do we think, for instance, that vast resources should be set aside
to preserve the imaginary prospects of a renewed mental life for
deeply comatose people, while there are no resources to spare to
enhance the desperate, but far from imaginary, expectations of the
poor? Myths about the sanctity of life, or of consciousness, cut
both ways. They may be useful in erecting barriers (against
euthanasia, against capital punishment, against abortion, against
eating meat) to impress the unimaginative, but at the price of
offensive hypocrisy or ridiculous self-deception among the more
enlightened." (page 454)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Leaving something out is not a feature of failed explanations, but
of successful explanations."</p>
<p>"Only a theory that explained conscious events in terms of
unconscious events could explain consciousness at all."</p>
