# Consciousness Explained, by Dennett

Dennett takes materialism as an axiom and uses it to prove there is no
dualist, soul-like consciousness, no audience in a “Cartesian
theater.” He thinks that if you imagine a [philosophical zombie][],
then you're imagining too hard, and if you don't think the
[Chinese room][] is conscious, then you aren't imagining hard enough.
His argument is that the brain must be where consciousness comes from,
and we know what kind of things are in the brain, so consciousness
must be from all that: lots of simple things together generate
consciousness and there's nothing more to the story. I don't feel like
it's explained.

Do I ask too much of an explanation of consciousness? Science is
fundamentally descriptive, after all. Maxwell's equations (etc.) don't
explain _why_ electromagnetism (etc.) is the way it is. They don't
really explain _how_ it works. Every theory is vulnerable to a child
repeatedly asking “why.” This is the kind of infinite regress Dennett
is trying to avoid. And yet, I am conscious. This _experience_ is the
phenomenon of interest. Being able to _have_ experiences. I don't
think there's anything being a magnet is like, but there is something
being me is like, and I'm not convinced Dennett explains the
difference.


It seems very much like a riff on [Society of Mind][], which I should
probably read as well, though I don't know whether it will be more
persuasive. Do people consider this a settled issue? At least in the
popular press, folks are still [pitching][] weird ideas and describing
consciousness as a “deep and abiding philosophical problem.” Is
Dennett's explanation bad, or do I just not want to understand?

For the most part, I think Dennett is [not even wrong][], because he
isn't explaining what he promises to. It is a challenge, though, to
imagine what explanation (between Dennett and dualism) I would prefer.

He's arguing this is the case because it would be too computationally
expensive to simulate a world, based on the graphics of Donkey Kong
being crummy. Perhaps this seemed convincing in 1991?

I do have some sympathy for this critique... What _would_ a
satisfactory explanation look like?

If you agree with Dennett, then do you agree that Google's
[LaMDA is conscious][]? According to Dennett, it might as well be, and
he doesn't identify any method for distinguishing.

I hadn't heard this one before.

Out of context, yes.

This protest is a little weird, given that earlier Dennett defines
"people" as "adult human beings" (not children?) and argues that
consciousness is largely a cultural phenomenon (so one culture could
be more conscious than another?).

Dennett implicitly rejects the possibility that there could be
something different, something not just more of the same, something
that is an explanation of consciousness rather than a rejection of a
dualist explanation.

This is really funny to me somehow. What a happy clam!

I agree that this is weird too.
