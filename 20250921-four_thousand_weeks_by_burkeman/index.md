# Four Thousand Weeks, by Burkeman


> “You could think of this book as an extended argument for the

Burkeman's subtitle is "Time Management for Mortals," but the [book][]
is mostly (though not entirely) opposed to time management. Some
advice is decent, but the core focus on mortality is dead on arrival.
The book is fairly incoherent as a whole, but it has made me think.

[book]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Thousand_Weeks:_Time_Management_for_Mortals


The author has many critiques of (other) productivity books. These
critiques are mostly wrong or exaggerated. One that I did find
meaningful was that often productivity is tied to the false belief
that things that aren't measured aren't valuable, as in
[The Tyranny of Metrics][]. This makes "productivity" sort of
self-centered, often; it isn't "productive" to volunteer, or engage in
civic life generally, to know local issues, to vote. This kind of
measurement-obsessed productivity, usually implicitly career-oriented,
becomes a misdirection of energy.

[The Tyranny of Metrics]: /20200425-tyranny_of_metrics_by_muller/


Burkeman accuses productivity advice of being unsustainable, but comes
down too far in the other direction, as if noting that it isn't
possible to sprint forever before concluding that all attempts to
cover distance are futile. This feels like the common tension between
accepting things exactly as they are as opposed to hating things as
they are and pushing to change them at all costs. As usual, neither
extreme is really great.


Burkeman wants you to live in the moment, which I tend to support as
well, but I don't agree with the reasoning having to come from
mortality. Fear of death can't really make you live in the moment;
death is in the future. Infinite life also wouldn't mean that choices
become meaningless; you would still have only one walk through the
garden of forking paths. Yes, value every moment—but not out of fear.
Not out of a scarcity mindset.

Burkeman references Seneca's [De Brevitate Vitae][] on page four. I
think at some point he mentioned [How to Live on 24 Hours a Day][] as
well.

On page eight Burkeman mentions three productivity books:
[The Four-Hour Work Week][], [Smarter, Faster, Better][], and Extreme
Productivity. I've read the first two, and after looking briefly into
the last, it looks like all of them in fact do talk a lot about
prioritizing and saying "no" to things. Burkeman's characterization of
the productivity literature as somehow ignoring this seems unfair.

Burkeman says on page nine that productivity works but makes us feel
busier. This has not been my experience. I feel less stress when
things are managed, and I'm able to confidently know that I've taken
care of what I needed to.

Some large chunk of good time management is just memory aids, I think:
Ways of organizing things so that they don't fall through the cracks
and create stressful problems later.

This is an interesting characterization of neurosis, especially when
considered along with psychosis, in which neurosis is sort of fighting
against (or worrying about) reality, while psychosis is instead a
clear break with reality.

I'm not sure that's what people usually think of when they think
"neurosis," but it's kind of neat.

This [Richard Bach][] and his books including _Jonathan Livingston
Seagull_ were apparently quite big in the 70s.

This is ridiculous. Maybe this is where his whole argument falls
apart. It's just not true that you have to do everything, and I think
this passage illustrates the silliness of it. Who would literally aim
to see "as much of the world as you possibly can" and have that mean
devoting equal time to every square inch? For his claims here to make
any sense you have to imagine both having overwhelming and
indiscriminate FOMO and absolutely no sense of prioritization. Both
are problems to resolve, not axioms to reason from.

I sometimes think a related thing, paraphrasing Descartes, "I think,
therefore something is going on." I tend to identify with this
Heidegger snippet. Existence is a miracle.

This Hägglund may have some worthwhile things to say, but I think that
like Burkeman he's wrong to focus so much on death as the most
important thing, and wrong that without death nothing would matter.

I hear Hägglund is critical of capitalism, but I can't help but think
that the focus on finitude is a capitalist economic argument: if
supply (of time) is unlimited, then price (value) goes to zero. (I
don't believe this.)

No, no, no. This might be one path of reasoning that helps a person
become more present, but it isn't the only or necessary path.

There's a section with these three principles:

 * Pay yourself first
 * Limit your work in progress
     *  [Personal Kanban](https://www.personalkanban.com/) suggests
        limiting to three things.
 * Resist the allure of middling priorities

This all seems like basically good advice.

So this Bergson guy wrote [Time and free will][] (mentioned on page
83) and, I mean, cool title, but otherwise doesn't seem that good,
especially if the thinking is similar in quality to Bergson's ideas
about motivated evolution.

> Machine for misusing your life (page 94)

Burkeman mostly tries to avoid the appearance of value judgments by
framing the objective as spending time on what you value (whatever
that is) but he does come out clearly against social media. So you
better not value social media!

There's an interesting sort of story about a monk's experience with
ice water, the point of which was that trying to ignore or deny the
experience of cold was worse than focusing on the experience and
accepting, living the experience.

He's trying to connect boredom to finitude in the sense of limited
lifespan, but he accidentally gives the lie to it. It isn't that
you're upset that you're using your limited time on Earth in a way
that isn't fun; it's that it isn't fun "in this moment."

He does talk about living in the moment, but doesn't seem to resolve
the conflict with the lifespan view.

This makes sense. What's the quote I think of... Eisenhower: "Plans
are worthless, but planning is everything." The plan has no influence
over the future, but it does help you make decisions in the moments
you encounter.

Burkeman mentions
[Radically Condensed Instructions for Being Just as You Are][], which
is more nondualist, the-moment-is-all-there-is stuff.

[Radically Condensed Instructions for Being Just as You Are]: https://www.amazon.com/dp/1456312030

_Trying_ to live in the moment is like trying too hard to sleep.
Trying to force it pushes you further from it. But on the other hand,
you have no other option but to be here now.

Burkeman mentions Lafargue's [The right to be lazy][].

I think Burkeman also talks about instrumental use of time and tourist
photography, the "stop taking pictures and experience it" argument.

I think of my "[Is it worth doing even if it fails?][]" which I think
is somewhat related... value the act itself regardless of the outcome.

Burkeman talks about a painting called "Boy with a Squirrel," but that
painting is "A Boy with a Flying Squirrel." [Flying][]!

[Flying]: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Boy_with_a_Flying_Squirrel

> It depicts Copley's teenaged half-brother Henry Pelham with a pet

How cool is that!

There are "Three principles of patience" (around page 180)

 * Develop a taste for having problems
     * This reminds me of my first "thinking card,"
       [embrace problems][].
 * Embrace radical incrementalism 
 * Originality lies on the far side of unoriginality

Burkeman has this idea, "cosmic insignificance therapy," which is
intended to be a relief. It reminds me of the
[total perspective vortex][] from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the
Galaxy, but of course there it was supposed to be a method of torture.

Burkeman mentions this documentary, [A Life’s Work][].

To me this is about caring about something, whether it makes sense or
not, making meaning for yourself, and not really at all about death.
