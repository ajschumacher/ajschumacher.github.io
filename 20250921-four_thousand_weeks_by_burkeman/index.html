<h1>Four Thousand Weeks, by Burkeman</h1>
<p class="date">Sunday September 21, 2025</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You could think of this book as an extended argument for the
empowering potential of giving up hope.” (page 231)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Burkeman's subtitle is "Time Management for Mortals," but the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Thousand_Weeks:_Time_Management_for_Mortals">book</a>
is mostly (though not entirely) opposed to time management. Some
advice is decent, but the core focus on mortality is dead on arrival.
The book is fairly incoherent as a whole, but it has made me think.</p>
<p>The author has many critiques of (other) productivity books. These
critiques are mostly wrong or exaggerated. One that I did find
meaningful was that often productivity is tied to the false belief
that things that aren't measured aren't valuable, as in
<a href="/20200425-tyranny_of_metrics_by_muller/">The Tyranny of Metrics</a>. This makes "productivity" sort of
self-centered, often; it isn't "productive" to volunteer, or engage in
civic life generally, to know local issues, to vote. This kind of
measurement-obsessed productivity, usually implicitly career-oriented,
becomes a misdirection of energy.</p>
<p>Burkeman accuses productivity advice of being unsustainable, but comes
down too far in the other direction, as if noting that it isn't
possible to sprint forever before concluding that all attempts to
cover distance are futile. This feels like the common tension between
accepting things exactly as they are as opposed to hating things as
they are and pushing to change them at all costs. As usual, neither
extreme is really great.</p>
<p>Burkeman wants you to live in the moment, which I tend to support as
well, but I don't agree with the reasoning having to come from
mortality. Fear of death can't really make you live in the moment;
death is in the future. Infinite life also wouldn't mean that choices
become meaningless; you would still have only one walk through the
garden of forking paths. Yes, value every moment—but not out of fear.
Not out of a scarcity mindset.</p>

<hr />
<p>Burkeman references Seneca's <a href="/20240105-seneca_de_brevitate_vitae/">De Brevitate Vitae</a> on page four. I
think at some point he mentioned <a href="/20201107-how_to_live_on_24_hours_a_day/">How to Live on 24 Hours a Day</a> as
well.</p>
<hr />
<p>On page eight Burkeman mentions three productivity books:
<a href="/2011/03/14/listened-to-four-hour-work-week/">The Four-Hour Work Week</a>, <a href="/20220327-smarter_faster_better_by_duhigg/">Smarter, Faster, Better</a>, and Extreme
Productivity. I've read the first two, and after looking briefly into
the last, it looks like all of them in fact do talk a lot about
prioritizing and saying "no" to things. Burkeman's characterization of
the productivity literature as somehow ignoring this seems unfair.</p>
<hr />
<p>Burkeman says on page nine that productivity works but makes us feel
busier. This has not been my experience. I feel less stress when
things are managed, and I'm able to confidently know that I've taken
care of what I needed to.</p>
<p>Some large chunk of good time management is just memory aids, I think:
Ways of organizing things so that they don't fall through the cracks
and create stressful problems later.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>This struggle against the distressing constraints of reality is what
some old-school psychoanalysts call "neurosis," and it takes
countless forms, from workaholism and commitment-phobia to
codependency and chronic shyness.</p>
<p>Our troubled relationship with time arises largely from the same
effort to avoid the painful constraints of reality. (page 30)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is an interesting characterization of neurosis, especially when
considered along with psychosis, in which neurosis is sort of fighting
against (or worrying about) reality, while psychosis is instead a
clear break with reality.</p>
<p>I'm not sure that's what people usually think of when they think
"neurosis," but it's kind of neat.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>... I wrote this book for myself, as much as for anyone else,
putting my faith in the words of the author Richard Bach: "You teach
best what you most need to learn." (page 33)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Bach">Richard Bach</a> and his books including <em>Jonathan Livingston
Seagull</em> were apparently quite big in the 70s.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Think of it as “existential overwhelm”: the modern world provides an
inexhaustible supply of things that seem worth doing, and so there
arises an inevitable and unbridgeable gap between what you'd ideally
like to do and what you actually can do. (page 45)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>The harder you struggle to fit everything in, the more of your time
you'll find yourself spending on the least meaningful things. Adopt
an ultra-ambitious time management system that promises to take care
of your entire to-do list, and you probably won't even get around to
the most important items on that list. Dedicate your retirement to
seeing as much of the world as you possibly can, and you probably
won't even get to see the most interesting parts. (page 48)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is ridiculous. Maybe this is where his whole argument falls
apart. It's just not true that you have to do everything, and I think
this passage illustrates the silliness of it. Who would literally aim
to see "as much of the world as you possibly can" and have that mean
devoting equal time to every square inch? For his claims here to make
any sense you have to imagine both having overwhelming and
indiscriminate FOMO and absolutely no sense of prioritization. Both
are problems to resolve, not axioms to reason from.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>The most fundamental thing we fail to appreciate about the world,
Heidegger asserts in his magnum opus, <em>Being and Time,</em> is how
bafflingly astonishing it is that it’s there at all – the fact that
there is anything rather than nothing. Most philosophers and
scientists spend their careers pondering the <em>way</em> things are: what
sorts of things exist, where they come from, how they relate to each
other, and so on. But we’ve forgotten to be amazed <em>that</em> things are
in the first place – that ‘a world is worlding all around us’, as
Heidegger puts it. This fact – the fact that <em>there is being,</em> to
begin with – is ‘the brute reality on which all of us ought to be
constantly stubbing our toes’, in the splendid phrase of the writer
Sarah Bakewell. But instead, it almost always passes us by. (page
58)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I sometimes think a related thing, paraphrasing Descartes, "I think,
therefore something is going on." I tend to identify with this
Heidegger snippet. Existence is a miracle.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>In his 2019 book, This Life, the Swedish philosopher Martin Hägglund
makes this all a bit clearer and less mystical by juxtaposing the
idea of facing our finitude with the religious belief in an eternal
life. If you really thought life would never end, he argues, then
nothing could ever genuinely matter, because you’d never be faced
with having to decide whether or not to use a portion of your
precious life on something. ‘If I believed that my life would last
forever,’ Hägglund writes, ‘I could never take my life to be at
stake, and I would never be seized by the need to do anything with
my time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This Hägglund may have some worthwhile things to say, but I think that
like Burkeman he's wrong to focus so much on death as the most
important thing, and wrong that without death nothing would matter.</p>
<p>I hear Hägglund is critical of capitalism, but I can't help but think
that the focus on finitude is a capitalist economic argument: if
supply (of time) is unlimited, then price (value) goes to zero. (I
don't believe this.)</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>It is by consciously confronting the certainty of death, and what
follows from the certainty of death, that we finally become truly
present for our lives. (page 63)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, no, no. This might be one path of reasoning that helps a person
become more present, but it isn't the only or necessary path.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>The real measure of any time management technique is <em>whether or not
it helps you neglect the right things.</em> (page 72)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>There's a section with these three principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay yourself first</li>
<li>Limit your work in progress<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.personalkanban.com/">Personal Kanban</a> suggests
    limiting to three things.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Resist the allure of middling priorities</li>
</ul>
<p>This all seems like basically good advice.</p>
<hr />
<p>So this Bergson guy wrote <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_and_Free_Will">Time and free will</a> (mentioned on page
83) and, I mean, cool title, but otherwise doesn't seem that good,
especially if the thinking is similar in quality to Bergson's ideas
about motivated evolution.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Machine for misusing your life (page 94)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Burkeman mostly tries to avoid the appearance of value judgments by
framing the objective as spending time on what you value (whatever
that is) but he does come out clearly against social media. So you
better not value social media!</p>
<hr />
<p>There's an interesting sort of story about a monk's experience with
ice water, the point of which was that trying to ignore or deny the
experience of cold was worse than focusing on the experience and
accepting, living the experience.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>You're obliged to deal with how your experience is unfolding in this
moment, to resign yourself to the reality that <em>this is it.</em> (page
106)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He's trying to connect boredom to finitude in the sense of limited
lifespan, but he accidentally gives the lie to it. It isn't that
you're upset that you're using your limited time on Earth in a way
that isn't fun; it's that it isn't fun "in this moment."</p>
<p>He does talk about living in the moment, but doesn't seem to resolve
the conflict with the lifespan view.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>The real problem isn’t planning. It’s that we take our plans to be
something they aren’t. What we forget, or can’t bear to confront, is
that, in the words of the American meditation teacher Joseph
Goldstein, ‘a plan is just a thought’. We treat our plans as though
they are a lasso, thrown from the present around the future, in
order to bring it under our command. But all a plan is – all it
could ever possibly be – is a present-moment statement of intent.
It’s an expression of your current thoughts about how you’d ideally
like to deploy your modest influence over the future. The future, of
course, is under no obligation to comply. (page 123)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This makes sense. What's the quote I think of... Eisenhower: "Plans
are worthless, but planning is everything." The plan has no influence
over the future, but it does help you make decisions in the moments
you encounter.</p>
<hr />
<p>Burkeman mentions
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1456312030">Radically Condensed Instructions for Being Just as You Are</a>, which
is more nondualist, the-moment-is-all-there-is stuff.</p>
<p><em>Trying</em> to live in the moment is like trying too hard to sleep.
Trying to force it pushes you further from it. But on the other hand,
you have no other option but to be here now.</p>
<hr />
<p>Burkeman mentions Lafargue's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Right_to_Be_Lazy">The right to be lazy</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"According to Lafargue, wage labour is tantamount to slavery, and to
fight as a labour movement for the extension of slavery is
preposterous. In the book, Lafargue proposes the right to be lazy,
in contrast to the right to work, which he deems bourgeois."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‘Nothing is more alien to the present age than idleness,’ writes the
philosopher John Gray. He adds: ‘How can there be play in a time
when nothing has meaning unless it leads to something else?’ (page
154)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think Burkeman also talks about instrumental use of time and tourist
photography, the "stop taking pictures and experience it" argument.</p>
<p>I think of my "<a href="/20181204-worth_doing_even_if_it_fails/">Is it worth doing even if it fails?</a>" which I think
is somewhat related... value the act itself regardless of the outcome.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>The publisher and editor Karen Rinaldi feels about surfing the same
way that I do about cheesy piano rock, only more so: she dedicates
every spare moment she can to it, and even wiped out her savings on
a plot of land in Costa Rica for better access to the sea. Yet she
readily admits that she remains an appalling surfer to this day. (It
took her five years of attempting to catch a wave before she first
managed to do so.) But ‘in the process of trying to attain a few
moments of bliss’, Rinaldi explains, ‘I experience something else:
patience and humility, definitely, but also freedom. Freedom to
pursue the futile. And the freedom to suck without caring is
revelatory.’ Results aren’t everything. Indeed, they’d better not
be, because results always come later – and later is always too
late. (page 160)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Burkeman talks about a painting called "Boy with a Squirrel," but that
painting is "A Boy with a Flying Squirrel." <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Boy_with_a_Flying_Squirrel">Flying</a>!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It depicts Copley's teenaged half-brother Henry Pelham with a pet
flying squirrel, a creature commonly found in colonial American
portraits as a symbol of the sitter's refinement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How cool is that!</p>
<hr />
<p>There are "Three principles of patience" (around page 180)</p>
<ul>
<li>Develop a taste for having problems<ul>
<li>This reminds me of my first "thinking card,"
   <a href="https://planspace.org/20201206-thinking_cards/#1">embrace problems</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Embrace radical incrementalism </li>
<li>Originality lies on the far side of unoriginality</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Burkeman has this idea, "cosmic insignificance therapy," which is
intended to be a relief. It reminds me of the
<a href="https://hitchhikers.fandom.com/wiki/Total_Perspective_Vortex">total perspective vortex</a> from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the
Galaxy, but of course there it was supposed to be a method of torture.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>There is a sort of cruelty, Iddo Landau points out, in holding
yourself to standards nobody could ever reach (and which many of us
would never dream of demanding of other people). The more humane
approach is to drop such efforts as completely as you can. Let your
impossible standards crash to the ground. Then pick a few meaningful
tasks from the rubble and get started on them today. (page 222)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Burkeman mentions this documentary, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13675784/">A Life’s Work</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What's it like to dedicate your life to work that won't be completed
in your lifetime? Fifteen years ago, filmmaker David Licata focused
on four projects and the people behind them in an effort to answer
this universal question.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To me this is about caring about something, whether it makes sense or
not, making meaning for yourself, and not really at all about death.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>You could think of this book as an extended argument for the
empowering potential of giving up hope. (page 231)</p>
