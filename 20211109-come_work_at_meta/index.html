<h1>Come work at Meta! (Facebook/Instagram/WhatsApp/etc.)</h1>
<p class="date">Tuesday November  9, 2021</p>
<p>[Update 2025-04-17]</p>
<p>For about three and a half years, I did open referrals. I referred
over 75 people. Two or three got jobs. People I referred were
sometimes upset when they didn't get interviews, as if they thought a
referral would entitle them to one. Meta has also changed incentives
for referrals, and many positions don't accept referrals at all any
more. In light of all this, my recommendation now is to apply through
the <a href="https://www.metacareers.com/jobs">Meta careers site</a>. Good luck!</p>
<!-- Old content:

People have started asking me to refer them for jobs at [Meta][],
which is great because Meta is [hiring][]! I'd be happy to refer you;
send [me](/aaron/) the following:

[Meta]: https://meta.com/
[hiring]: https://www.metacareers.com/jobs

1. Your full name
2. Your email address
3. Exactly one of:
    * Your resume in PDF format, or
    * A link to your LinkedIn profile, or
    * Tell me to put in your email address and you'll be prompted to
      provide information yourself. (I've never tried this.)
4. One to three job links from the [official jobs site][]
    * Not from LinkedIn, not from Indeed, etc. They have to be from
      the official jobs site to work in the system.
    * Ensure you meet the minimum requirements listed for each, and
      that the locations listed (including remote if applicable) are
      aligned with your preferences.
    * Unfortunately, not all roles accept referrals through the
      system, and I don't think you can see in advance which do/don't.
      If I can't submit a referral for any role you're interested in,
      you can still apply through the careers site.
5. Are you either of: a current university student or graduated from
   university within the last nine months? (yes/no)
6. How many years of industry experience do you have (not counting
   internships)? (one number)
7. Do you live in either of the EU or UK? (yes/no)
8. Are you interested in a position (from above) where you'd be based
   in the EU or UK? (yes/no)
9. Optional things
    * LinkedIn profile link
    * GitHub profile link
    * Portfolio website link
    * Brief note (one paragraph or less) on why you should be hired

[official jobs site]: https://www.metacareers.com/jobs


Once I have the above, I can put you into the system. After that, I
won't hear anything before you do. I can't guarantee any particular
next steps, but I wish you the best of luck and hope you do well!
