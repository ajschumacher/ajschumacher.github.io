# Come work at Meta! (Facebook/Instagram/WhatsApp/etc.)

People have started asking me to refer them for jobs at [Meta][],
which is great because Meta is [hiring][]! I'd be happy to refer you;
send [me](/aaron/) the following:

      provide information yourself. (I've never tried this.)
4. One to three job links from the [official jobs site][]
    * Not from LinkedIn, not from Indeed, etc. They have to be from
      the official jobs site to work in the system.

      that the locations listed (including remote if applicable) are
      aligned with your preferences.

Once I have the above, I can put you into the system. After that, I
won't hear anything before you do. I can't guarantee any particular
next steps, but I wish you the best of luck and hope you do well!
