# The Strangest Man, by Farmelo

I think I like this Graham Farmelo, and I like his book about Dirac.
Farmelo is interested in connections between mathematics and physics,
and aesthetics in both. I think I'll read some of his other books too.

Is it fair to say that a [spacetime interval][] _is_ “the square of
the distance between two points in space-time”? Maybe?

I think one could argue exactly the opposite...

This kind of thing is fascinating... What's still out there, that
could be seen in an afternoon, if we knew what to look for?

Is there such a mistake???

Russell has fiction!
