# (Audio) After Work, by Hester and Srnicek

Here's a feminist post-scarcity [book][] pointing out that abolishing
paid work won't automatically eliminate unpaid work. There's quite a
bit of unpaid work, and people may or may not want to do it.
Interesting history and ideas on what to do about it.

Did you know there was a [Wages for Housework][] movement in the 70s?

> for the young, the healthy, the able bodied, and the middle class
> with minimal caring responsibilities – that specific and limited
> range of people who might be best able to thrive in a space like
> Drop City). As such, they consciously operated as enclaves within
> the society from which they sought to withdraw – bastions of
> alternative values which were yet to flourish elsewhere – and the
> interventions they staged were in certain respects hyperlocal to the
> point of being site-specific. The ‘simple positing and practising of
> a new world is insufficient to overcome’ the structural forces
> preventing its generalisation.129 Or, as Mike Davis puts it,
> ‘demonstration projects in … rich countries will not save the
