<h1>(Audio) After Work, by Hester and Srnicek</h1>
<p class="date">Saturday October 19, 2024</p>
<p>Here's a feminist post-scarcity <a href="https://www.versobooks.com/products/496-after-work" title="After Work: A History of the Home and the Fight for Free Time by Helen Hester and Nick Srnicek">book</a> pointing out that abolishing
paid work won't automatically eliminate unpaid work. There's quite a
bit of unpaid work, and people may or may not want to do it.
Interesting history and ideas on what to do about it.</p>
<p>Did you know there was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wages_for_housework" title="Wikipedia: Wages for housework">Wages for Housework</a> movement in the 70s?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“As we know, domestic realism was not ultimately overthrown by the
communalism of the separatists or the hippies. While some
communities are still operational, Drop City and the vast majority
of initiatives like it proved to be relatively ephemeral
experiments, failing to outlive their moment of sociosexual
upheaval. This may well have been because, as sites of exodus, they
were not always effective at ensuring their own scalability. They
were often intended as prefigurative spaces, aiming to offer a taste
of post-suburban utopia in the here and now (or at least, a utopia
for the young, the healthy, the able bodied, and the middle class
with minimal caring responsibilities – that specific and limited
range of people who might be best able to thrive in a space like
Drop City). As such, they consciously operated as enclaves within
the society from which they sought to withdraw – bastions of
alternative values which were yet to flourish elsewhere – and the
interventions they staged were in certain respects hyperlocal to the
point of being site-specific. The ‘simple positing and practising of
a new world is insufficient to overcome’ the structural forces
preventing its generalisation.129 Or, as Mike Davis puts it,
‘demonstration projects in … rich countries will not save the
world’.” (page 114)</p>
