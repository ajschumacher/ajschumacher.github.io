# How much money do I need to retire? by Tresidder

Tresidder is in some ways likeable and reasonable, and in other ways
sort of a skinny-FIRE [Robert Kiyosaki][] who is "retired" but still
shills constantly in the direction of his $1,750 [online course][]
like he read [The 4-hour work week][].

Most of the book is criticism. On page one we get "Traditional
retirement planning has failed." It all feels mostly like a sales
tactic: His approach is the one that works!

He spends a lot of time criticizing Monte Carlo methods. His
explanation of the approach in general is so bad it must be
deliberately so. Unsavory rhetoric.

There is a reasonable argument buried in his hate for MC methods: He
thinks they don't go far enough in considering more extreme possible
futures, while their confidence intervals make them _seem_ all-knowing
when they're not. They generally won't model Social Security
disappearing altogether, for example, but they'll still allocate 100%
of probability, as if there's a 0% chance of these sorts of "extreme"
futures.

So his solution is a sort of manual Monte Carlo, putting lots of weird
things into (his, of course) calculators.

He also correctly, I think, focuses on the human reality of living
just one life, not a probability distribution of lives, so what we
really need is to eliminate extreme downside risk as much as possible.

How much of the retirement planning literature is just confusion about
inflation? Possibly a lot, I think.

It turns out his solution is mostly from the skinny-FIRE school of
thought: Spend less! Then there's the [Robert Kiyosaki][] part: Cash
flow! Real estate!

I object to telling people to become landlords like it's easy, good,
and risk-free. The general idea of not dipping into your capital seems
fine though. But now are we just back to the original methods he
despises, only worse off because we're imagining the capital is safe
(and even grows with inflation)? I think yes.

There are some good vibes about enjoying your life, and maybe his
recommendation to consider a longevity annuity is reasonable, but for
the most part this book is more an advertisement than a resource.

I think this is supposed to be Picasso? But his usage is unattributed?
Sort of weird, given how much he likes to include well-known quotes
otherwise.

This is not a debate! See, for example,
[Life expectancy is historically misleading ](/20200806-life_expectancy_is_historically_misleading/).

This is part of his idea that he can time the market based on P/E.
Valuations aren't nothing, but his takes are a bit much.

How does this make sense?

It's sort of amazing that he would say this. Your effective tax rate
could easily be cut in half at retirement if you're earning a bunch
and saving most of it before retirement.

I do like this quote.

Also not terrible.

What? Really?

This is assuming 10% annual return over 45 years? And it's nominal?
(With inflation, more like $20 purchasing power?)

I guess he's just trying to be dramatic, but I would rather he not be
dramatic with numbers.

Tresidder paints "cash flow" methods as immune from risk, and
generally somehow automatically protected from inflation. This isn't
the case!

(The book is structured and presented as if it is.)
