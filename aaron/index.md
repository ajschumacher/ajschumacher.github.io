I made a little [FAQ][] based on questions I get from people. I have a
[vision and mission][]. Here's an [hour][] of me talking about career
stuff.

Sometimes people ask me for a bio:

> Aaron Schumacher is a Data Scientist at Meta. He was previously at
> Deep Learning Analytics and General Dynamics Mission Systems. He has
> taught with Python and R for General Assembly and the Metis data
> science bootcamp. Aaron has also worked with data at Booz Allen
> Hamilton, New York University, and the New York City Department of
> Education. He studied mathematics at the University of
> Wisconsin–Madison and teaching mathematics at Bard College. Aaron's
> career-best breakdancing result was advancing to the semi-finals of
> the R16 Korea 2009 individual footwork battle.

[An older version of the above](https://www.oreilly.com/people/aaron-schumacher)
went up on O'Reilly with the publication of
[Hello, TensorFlow!](https://www.oreilly.com/learning/hello-tensorflow).
The following accompanies the
[Chinese version](https://www.oreilly.com.cn/ideas/?p=533):

> Aaron Schumacher是深度学习分析公司的数据科学家和软件工程师。他在联合国大会和麦迪斯数据科学训练营里教授Python和R语言。Aaron曾在博思艾伦咨询公司，纽约大学和纽约市教育局任职并从事数据工作。Aaron生涯最好的霹雳舞成绩是挺近R16韩国2009大赛个人街舞的半决赛。他现在很荣幸地被评为TensorFlow 0.9版的次重要贡献者。
