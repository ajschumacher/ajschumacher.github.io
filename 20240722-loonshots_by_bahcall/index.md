# (Audio) Loonshots, by Bahcall

It's a fun book, especially at the beginning, where Bahcall has a lot
of underdog success stories. I think some of the ideas are decent, but
it's also more like an unfinished brainstorming session than a settled
science, and it's hard to distinguish useful theory from just-so
history. I'm fundamentally on board for more discoveries though!

A major metaphor in the book is "phase transitions," like solid to
liquid. Bahcall offers "The Innovation Equation" (details in
[HBR article][]) for \\( M \\), "a certain size at which human groups
shift from embracing radical ideas to quashing them."

\\[ M = \frac{E S^{2} F}{G} \\]


The only right hand term that isn't unitless is \\( S \\), "management
span," which is the average number of direct reports that managers
have. Since \\( S \\) is squared, the result is in units of people
squared, which I don't think makes sense. With his training as a
physicist, it's a little surprising that Bahcall would do this. (Am I
missing something?)


Also surprising is that there's no constant term. (For example,
gravity isn't mass times mass divided by distance squared; there's a
constant that we have to get from data.) Bahcall plugs in \\( E = 50\%
\\), meaning compensation is 50% equity, which seems rare, then
management span of 6, and \\( F = 1 \\) meaning equal returns to
project work and politics, finishing with \\( G = 12\% \\) meaning 12%
compensation increase at promotion. Ignoring the units, this gives
150, and he claims a connection with [Dunbar's number][], saying
"That's interesting."

I have to think Bahcall doesn't really take this equation seriously;
he must intend it as an illustration for his narrative. Still, it
offends my sensibilities because it seems like math-washing:
presenting something that looks "fancy" to make it seem more
legitimate. In this case, the evidence isn't really anything more than
suggestive.


One issue is boundaries: Where does an organization begin and end?
DARPA is considered an example of an innovative organization. Do we
consider just the DARPA PMs? Also their contractors? The whole
Department of Defense?


I think a much more promising attempt might be made by switching from
the organization to the individual view: At what point does an
individual change their behavior, based on the local structure of
their organization and incentives? This would also be more coherent
with Bahcall's ideas about having different parts of an organization
working on different goals (loonshots vs. "franchise" work). How do
you get loonshots? Support people who work on them.


A deeper critique is that Bahcall's "loonshot" forces here seem more
about _doing your job_ than about working on crazy innovative ideas
specifically. "Project work" is not necessarily loonshot work.

This "Goals Gone Wild" [paper][] is pretty fun, and reminds me of
[The Tyranny of Metrics][]. The paper includes this warning label:

Also referenced (a lot) is Vannevar Bush's 1945
[Science: The Endless Frontier][], which reminds me of
[The Beginning of Infinity][].

This is an interesting idea: What's out there that's known but
ignored, currently, when it shouldn't be ignored? Bahcall uses the
example of radar's foundations being known but ignored by the Navy for
nearly 20 years. What fun things are out there, already discovered but
not yet exposed to sunlight?
