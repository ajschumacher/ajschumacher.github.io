<h1>Thank You for Reaching Out</h1>
<p class="date">Sunday March 19, 2017</p>
<p>I make myself pretty <a href="/aaron/">easy to contact</a>, and sometimes people contact me.</p>
<h3>1. Will I hire you?</h3>
<p>I'm not in a position to hire you (or give you an internship). Please don't send me your résumé. If you want to work where I work, or anywhere I've worked before, please go through official channels.</p>
<h3>2. Will I recommend you for a job?</h3>
<p>If I already know your work and I know it to be good, then yes.</p>
<h3>3. How can you find a job?</h3>
<p>I've found jobs mostly through people I know, and once through a recruiter.</p>
<p>Don't meet people for the sake of finding a job. Meet people by being active in your community and doing good work. Go to a <a href="https://www.meetup.com/">meetup</a>. Talk to people. Help where you can. Give a talk about something you know or are learning about. Help out on a <a href="http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/brigade/">community project</a>. Keep developing new skills.</p>
<p>The majority of the cold contacts I get are from recruiters. I don't have an answer for them on this page because they don't <em>care</em>; it is their <em>job</em> to contact people all the time—even people who don't seem to be looking for work—on the off chance that they make a contact at exactly the right time. Can they find you? They will send you jobs.</p>
<h3>4. How can you develop skills?</h3>
<p>I have a presentation about my career path and things I think are very generally important. It's called <a href="/20151206-how_to_eat_computers/">How to Eat Computers</a> and it was made for children, but even such a very mature person as you might enjoy it.</p>
<p>I have two short lists of recommended books:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/20160322-books_for_programmers/">Books for Programmers</a></li>
<li><a href="/20160320-books_for_professionals/">Books for Professionals</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You should read and write a lot. Develop interests and pursue them.</p>
<h3>5. What educational program should you do?</h3>
<p>You should go for the best program(s) you can, but remember that individual (student) variability is much larger than variability between programs.</p>
<h3>6. Should you do online courses?</h3>
<p>This is like asking "Should I read books?" Put them in the same category. Choose what will best help you learn what you want to learn.</p>
<h3>7. Should you do a coding bootcamp?</h3>
<p>Don't think of a bootcamp as a credential. They don't play in the same world as graduate degrees. If you go for a bootcamp, you are saying to the world that you are <em>scrappy</em>; you are going to <em>work hard</em> and you are going to <em>make something happen</em>. The structures of the program may help you to do more than you would on your own, but no program can do everything for you.</p>
<p>At the end of the program you are going to have your work to show and talk about. Could you have done that work without the program? Yes. Would you have?</p>
<h3>8. What's the best coding bootcamp?</h3>
<p>I've taught data science evening classes for <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/">General Assembly</a> and the full-time program for <a href="https://www.thisismetis.com/">Metis</a>. I developed some materials and I hope I helped both programs, but things vary a lot with locations, staff, and time: I don't know which programs are better than others.</p>
<h3>9. Will I collaborate with you? Will I be your mentor?</h3>
<p>If you have a project or question that you think I'm uniquely positioned to help with, let's talk about that project or question.</p>
<p>If you're looking for people in general but don't yet have a project or question to talk about, thank you for thinking of me, and please contact me if I am still the right person to talk to after you do. I keep some project ideas in my blog's <a href="https://github.com/ajschumacher/ajschumacher.github.io/issues">github issues</a>; you could look there to see if anything interests you.</p>    </article>
