<h1>Thinking Cards</h1>
<p class="date">Sunday December  6, 2020</p>
<p>Inspired by <a href="/2013/09/28/polyas-how-to-solve-it-quotes-and-comments/">How to Solve It</a>, <a href="/20200716-lateral_thinking_creativity_step_by_step/">Lateral Thinking</a>, and others,
I've started to collect tactics for problem-solving. The shuffling
stuff is so that you can easily choose a random tactic to try.</p>
<p>I might do more with this and I'd love feedback/suggestions;
<a href="#contact">comment or message me</a>!</p>

<div class="card">
<hr />
<h3><a href="#1" name="1">1</a>. Embrace problems</h3>
<p>The word "problem" has a negative connotation, and some problems are
hard to love. But in general, problems make life more interesting and
give us opportunities to learn, grow, and improve. Keep your problems
close.</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<hr />
<h3><a href="#2" name="2">2</a>. Take care of yourself</h3>
<p>Are you hungry? Tired? Stressed? Eat well, sleep well, and look after
your mental health. Try to do something right now to make your body
and mind more effective, like stretching.</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<hr />
<h3><a href="#3" name="3">3</a>. Take the pressure off</h3>
<p>What can you do to approach the problem calmly? Should you ask for
help or otherwise communicate with others? Should you make a back-up
plan or adjust your goal?</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<hr />
<h3><a href="#4" name="4">4</a>. Reinforce the positive</h3>
<p>You have an opportunity for growth. You're learning. Celebrate all
progress, even small progress. Feel good about what you're doing. You
can do this.</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<hr />
<h3><a href="#5" name="5">5</a>. Remove distractions</h3>
<p>Turn off the TV. Turn off your phone. Turn off notifications. Don't
check the news. Multitasking is a lie. If other thoughts come, jot
them down elsewhere to return to later.</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<hr />
<h3><a href="#6" name="6">6</a>. Get inspired</h3>
<p>Why are you working on this? What's the larger goal? What are the
larger benefits? What other problems or people have done work you
admire? Appreciate and aspire to greatness.</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<hr />
<h3><a href="#7" name="7">7</a>. Make a plan</h3>
<p>If you know how to attack the problem, make a plan to do that. Even if
you don't, make a plan to spend time on the problem, not all at once,
but consistently over a longer period.</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<hr />
<h3><a href="#8" name="8">8</a>. Do other things</h3>
<p>Don't forget to eat and sleep, but also, spend time on complementary
and even unrelated tasks. Read a book. Tutor a student. Revisit other
things. Take a walk.</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<hr />
<h3><a href="#9" name="9">9</a>. Work hard</h3>
<p>You need to focus. You need to put in time and effort. Sometimes you
have to stop looking for shortcuts and do the work. There is no royal
road. Work harder than anyone else.</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<hr />
<h3><a href="#10" name="10">10</a>. Relax</h3>
<p>Take some time to change the nature of your focus on the problem. Pull
back from single-minded concentration. Don't focus on anything else
either. Relax. Don't micromanage your brain. What comes to you?</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<hr />
<h3><a href="#11" name="11">11</a>. Work smart</h3>
<p>Even if you're already making progress, is there something you could
do more effectively? Can you find a better process if you reconsider?</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<hr />
<h3><a href="#12" name="12">12</a>. Find support</h3>
<p>What would help you to be effective? Is there a group or team you can
join or form? What people or other resources can you engage with?</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<hr />
<h3><a href="#13" name="13">13</a>. Understand the problem</h3>
<p>Do you completely understand what you're working on? Are all the
definitions clear? Does everyone involved agree on the problem
statement and objective?</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<hr />
<h3><a href="#14" name="14">14</a>. Find roots</h3>
<p>What is the root cause (or causes) of the problem? Is the problem as
stated the real problem? How did the problem come to be? Keep asking
why.</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<hr />
<h3><a href="#15" name="15">15</a>. Know what you know</h3>
<p>What do you know, and how do you know it? Are you sure? Could you
explain it to someone else? What do you not know, and how could you
come to know it? What else might be relevant?</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<hr />
<h3><a href="#16" name="16">16</a>. Question assumptions</h3>
<p>What are you taking for granted? What is so obvius that you haven't
thought about it? What biases might be affecting your thinking? Are
there alternatives that seem "out there"?</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<hr />
<h3><a href="#17" name="17">17</a>. Find similar problems</h3>
<p>Do you know a related problem? What have others done in similar
situations? How is a similar problem solved in nature, or in another
field? Can you build on work you or others have done before?</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<hr />
<h3><a href="#18" name="18">18</a>. Consider quitting</h3>
<p>Is this a problem that shouldn't be solved? Is this problem the right
use of your time, right now? What if you didn't solve this particular
problem?</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<hr />
<h3><a href="#19" name="19">19</a>. Get an easy win</h3>
<p>Find a task that you can succeed at in the next two minutes. It could
be getting out a pen, or opening a book. Do it, then praise yourself
for that victory. It may be easier to keep making progress afterward.</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<hr />
<h3><a href="#20" name="20">20</a>. Start things cooking</h3>
<p>Many tasks involve some waiting after you initiate them, like waiting
for food to marinate, or waiting for responses to an email. Make a
point to get these things started as soon as you can.</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<hr />
<h3><a href="#21" name="21">21</a>. Take a step</h3>
<p>Even if you're not sure of your whole plan, do something now. You can
always reevaluate afterward. Choose some goal that you can accomplish,
and do it now.</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<hr />
<h3><a href="#22" name="22">22</a>. Do an experiment</h3>
<p>You don't have to only do things that you know will work. Try
something and see what happens. Be prepared to throw it away. You'll
learn from it and it will help you to make progress.</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<hr />
<h3><a href="#23" name="23">23</a>. Guess and check</h3>
<p>A particular kind of experiment is to choose a next step, even if you
don't know that it's right, and see what happens next. Follow the
consequences forward. Even if you guessed wrong, you'll learn
something.</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<hr />
<h3><a href="#24" name="24">24</a>. Write down what you’ve done</h3>
<p>Keep some log of what you've been doing, what you've tried, and what
the results have been. If you haven't been doing this, try to remember
and write down what you've done so far.</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<hr />
<h3><a href="#25" name="25">25</a>. Try again</h3>
<p>Sometimes when you try something and it doesn't work, it isn't that
the approach was bad, it's that something didn't align that time. It
could be worth trying again, especially with things you tried when you
knew less.</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<hr />
<h3><a href="#26" name="26">26</a>. Zoom in</h3>
<p>How close can you get to the tiniest pieces? What happens for exactly
one component? For a global problem, how does a single individual play
a part on a daily basis?</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<hr />
<h3><a href="#27" name="27">27</a>. Zoom out</h3>
<p>What's the big picture? How does the problem fit into larger systems?
What's the global view? What's the long term view?</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<hr />
<h3><a href="#28" name="28">28</a>. Draw a picture</h3>
<p>Make a graphical representation. It could be a sketch, a plot, a
diagram, a mind map, a flow chart. Make something you can see.</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<hr />
<h3><a href="#29" name="29">29</a>. Change representations</h3>
<p>What's another way to conceptualize the problem? In math, you might
switch between numeric, geometric, and algebraic forms. You might
change domains, or phrase the problem as a story.</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<hr />
<h3><a href="#30" name="30">30</a>. Use a different tool</h3>
<p>Try saying it out loud. Try typing, or writing longhand, or recording
a video. Try post-it notes or index cards. Try paper and pencil, or a
calculator, a diagramming tool, or a programming language.</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<hr />
<h3><a href="#31" name="31">31</a>. Use analogy</h3>
<p>What else is this like? Can you compare to something else, even if
it's a stretch? What do the similarities and differences tell you?</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<hr />
<h3><a href="#32" name="32">32</a>. Change viewpoints</h3>
<p>How does this look from different perspectives? How do different
people, pieces, places see the problem? Can you imagine yourself in
different positions?</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<hr />
<h3><a href="#33" name="33">33</a>. Organize concepts</h3>
<p>What's the deep structure of this problem? Can you model the problem?
Are there axes or other ways of representing the ideas of your
problem?</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<hr />
<h3><a href="#34" name="34">34</a>. Add randomness</h3>
<p>Consider something you wouldn't otherwise: a random word, WikiPedia
article, or the concept of randomness itself. Go to a museum, or a
store. Whatever you find, relate it to your problem. What could it
mean?</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<hr />
<h3><a href="#35" name="35">35</a>. Talk it through</h3>
<p>Have a conversation with someone. Or imagine a conversation with
someone. Or have a conversation with yourself. Explain everything
you're thinking about.</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<hr />
<h3><a href="#36" name="36">36</a>. Decompose/Recompose</h3>
<p>What are the words and ideas that you're using? Are they cliché? Are
they appropriate? What if you broke down the way you're understanding
the problem and rebuilt it? Can you articulate the problem and
solution spaces?</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<hr />
<h3><a href="#37" name="37">37</a>. Get feedback</h3>
<p>Get an outside view on your problem and your work on it. Try to
solicit feedback that helps you see things you aren't otherwise
seeing.</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<hr />
<h3><a href="#38" name="38">38</a>. Learn more</h3>
<p>You may not know enough to solve your problem, and you may not even
know what it is that you don't know. Keep learning! Be curious about
topics near and far. Read and study for pleasure.</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<hr />
<h3><a href="#39" name="39">39</a>. Ask for help</h3>
<p>Other people can help you a lot. Put effort into finding the right
place and way to ask, and others will often put effort into helping
you.</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<hr />
<h3><a href="#40" name="40">40</a>. Break it up</h3>
<p>Sometimes you can break big problems into many more manageable steps.
It may even be possible for multiple people to work on separate parts.
Regardless, pursue and celebrate partial progress.</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<hr />
<h3><a href="#41" name="41">41</a>. Use inversion</h3>
<p>How might you achieve the opposite of your goal? Are there other
reversals or inversions that might be illuminating? What's the worst
case outcome? Can you avoid it?</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<hr />
<h3><a href="#42" name="42">42</a>. Make a list</h3>
<p>Generate lots of ideas. What are all the options? Consider more
possibilities. What else could you make a list of?</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<hr />
<h3><a href="#43" name="43">43</a>. Eliminate possibilities</h3>
<p>What can you rule out? What hasn't worked already? What's impossible?
What has to be wrong? Why is that? What are the constraints? What can
you learn from what doesn't work?</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<hr />
<h3><a href="#44" name="44">44</a>. Work backward</h3>
<p>Assume you have a solution. How would it come to be? What would
immediately lead to it? Can you follow steps backward from the end?</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<hr />
<h3><a href="#45" name="45">45</a>. Consider special cases</h3>
<p>Are there some specific forms of the problem that are more tractable
or help with understanding? Can you extend a method based on these?</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<hr />
<h3><a href="#46" name="46">46</a>. Consider extremes</h3>
<p>What if something in your problem disappeared, or was huge? What if
the problem itself was much worse, or more minor?</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<hr />
<h3><a href="#47" name="47">47</a>. Add a constraint</h3>
<p>Add a deadline for something. Can you come up with ten ideas in ten
minutes? What if you have to be done today? What if your techniques or
resources were limited? What if you couldn't use a tool you're
currently using?</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<hr />
<h3><a href="#48" name="48">48</a>. Simplify</h3>
<p>In what ways could a complicated problem be made less so? What does
simplifying it mean? Can you solve the simpler problem? If so, is that
good enough, or is there a way to build on the solution?</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<hr />
<h3><a href="#49" name="49">49</a>. Generalize</h3>
<p>Can you make your problem a special case of some other problem? Can
you solve that problem? Maybe a general-purpose tool or approach can
be used or adapted for your problem.</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<hr />
<h3><a href="#50" name="50">50</a>. Change the goal</h3>
<p>Maybe you don't need to solve exactly the problem you started with.
What's most important? Can you focus on that? Can you compromise to
find something that you can make progress on?</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<hr />
<h3><a href="#51" name="51">51</a>. Imagine the end</h3>
<p>"Begin with the end in mind." What would a solution look like? Would
it necessarily have certain properties? What properties?</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<hr />
<h3><a href="#52" name="52">52</a>. Find checks</h3>
<p>If you had a solution, how would you know that it's a good solution?
What would be the "check" in a "guess and check" approach? What can
you learn from your checks?</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<hr />
<h3><a href="#53" name="53">53</a>. Think beyond the end</h3>
<p>If you had a solution, what would you do next? How does this step fit
into your ideas for where you want to go? Would you be happy, once you
had a solution? Why?</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<hr />
<h3><a href="#54" name="54">54</a>. Choose the right tactic</h3>
<p>Which tactic is the one that will help you the most right now?
Choosing them should be natural as you work on problems all the time.
Think about your problem and what would be best.</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<hr />
<h3><a href="#55" name="55">55</a>. Make your own tactic</h3>
<p>Add a new tactic that works for you. What fits with how you think, and
the problems that you care about? Have you learned something that
works for you? Do you need something specific to your current problem?</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<hr />
<h3><a href="#56" name="56">56</a>. Implement an existing solution</h3>
<p>Try applying an approach that's worked for you or someone else in the
past, even if it came from a slightly different problem. What do you
learn from trying this? Can you adapt the solution?</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<hr />
<h3><a href="#57" name="57">57</a>. Quantify your progress</h3>
<p>Can you measure how much you've done, and how much is left to to?
Finding a metric can help you better understand your goal and what's
working to get you there.</p>
