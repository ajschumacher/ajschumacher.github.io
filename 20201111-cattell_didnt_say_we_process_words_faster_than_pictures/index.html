<h1>Cattell didn't say we process words faster than pictures</h1>

<p>This is consistent with words being distinct from the concepts they
represent.</p>
<hr />
<p>Reading the excellent
<a href="https://www.northernpublicradio.org/post/how-flawed-idea-teaching-millions-kids-be-poor-readers">How a flawed idea is teaching millions of kids to be poor readers</a>,
I was struck by this interesting claim:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If you're a skilled reader, your brain has gotten so good at
reading words that you process the word "chair" faster than you
process a picture of a chair."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That sentence points to footnote 34:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This was established in the late 19th century by a researcher named
James Cattell who compared reaction times to words and images using
a newly developed timing mechanism that could measure reactions to
within 1/1,000th of a second. See <a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Essentials+of+Assessing%2C+Preventing%2C+and+Overcoming+Reading+Difficulties+-p-9781118845240">this book</a>, p. 30."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That book is
<a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/-p-9781118845240">Essentials of Assessing, Preventing, and Overcoming Reading Difficulties</a>,
and the relevant paragraph on page 30 is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"James Cattell published a paper in 1886 demonstrating a newly
developed timing mechanism that could measure reaction times to
within 1 millisecond (i.e., 1/1,000th of a second). With this level
of precision, he discovered that the reaction times for reading
printed words like <em>chair</em> or <em>tree</em> were faster than reaction times
for naming a chair or a tree when shown a picture of those items.
Thus, over 125 years ago, there was evidence that naming objects and
naming written words were not the same skills, contrary to our
intuitions."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That 1886 paper is <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mind/article-abstract/os-XI/41/63/2888375">The Time it Takes to See and Name Objects</a>. The
paper is under three pages long. It doesn't convince me that Cattell
had millisecond precision in his measurements, and it's not
principally about comparing words and images. There's one relevant
paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The time required to see and name colours and pictures of objects
was determined in the same way. The time was found to be about the
same (over Â½sec.) for colours as for pictures, and about twice as
long as for words and letters. Other experiments I have made show
that we can recognise a single colour or picture in a slightly
shorter time than a word or letter, but take longer to name it. This
is because in the case of words and letters the association between
the idea and name has taken place so often that the process has
become automatic, whereas in the case of colours and pictures we
must by a voluntary effort choose the name. Such experiments would
be useful in investigating aphasia."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It isn't explained in the paper, but I have to imagine he measured
recognition as distinct from naming via some mechanism like tapping
when you see a picture of a tree, for example.</p>
<p>So the consistency of the quotes above with the Cattell source depends
on what it means "to process." If it means "to name," then it's
consistent. But if it means "to recognize," which I think is more
natural, then it doesn't convey the result Cattell published.</p>
<p>I think this is all fascinating; I'd love to learn about more recent
research on this topic.</p>    </article>
