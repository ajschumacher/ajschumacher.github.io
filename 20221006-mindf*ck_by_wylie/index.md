on OCEAN, Republicans are low openness, high conscientiousness
(Democrats the reverse)

> "This [idea to simulate behavior with computers] brought to mind

> "A select minority of people exhibit traits of narcissism (extreme

> and neuroticism—these "dark triad" traits are maladaptive, meaning
> that those who exhibit them are generally more prone to antisocial
> behavior, including criminal acts. From the data CA collected, the
> team was able to identify people who exhibited neuroticism and
> dark-triad traits, and those who were more prone to impulsive anger
> or conspiratorial thinking than average citizens. Cambridge
> Analytica would target them, introducing narratives via Facebook
> groups, ads, or articles that the firm knew from internal testing
> were likely to inflame the very narrow segments of people with these

> "Cambridge Analytica's research panels also identified that there
> were relationships between target attitudes and a psychological
> effect called the _just-world hypothesis_ (JWH). This is a cognitive
> bias where some people rely on a presumption of a fair world: The
> world is a fair place where bad things "happen for a reason" or will
> be offset by some sort of "moral balancing" in the universe. We
> found that people who displayed the JWH bias were, for example, more
> prone to victim-blaming in hypothetical scenarios of sexual assault.
> If the world is fair, then random bad things should not happen to
> innocent people, and therefore there must have been a fault in the
> victim's behavior. Finding ways to blame victims is psychologically
> prophylactic for some people because it helps them cope with anxiety
> induced by uncontrollable environmental threats while maintaining a
> comforting view that the world will still be fair _to them_.

> "Cambridge Analytica found that JWH was related to many attitudes,
