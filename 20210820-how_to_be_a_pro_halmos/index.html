<h1>How to be a pro (Halmos)</h1>
<p class="date">Friday August 20, 2021</p>
<p>This is a section (pages 264-268) from
<a href="https://smile.amazon.com/I-Want-be-Mathematician-Automathography/dp/0387960783/">I want to be a mathematician</a>, by Halmos.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anna, one of the mathematics department secretaries at Chicago,
complained to me once when we met at a party and she had already
consumed several gin and tonics. She was a good typist, and she
didn't have much trouble picking up the art of technical,
mathematical, typing—but she hated every minute of it. You have to
look at every symbol separately, you have to keep changing "typits"
or Selectric balls, you have to shift a half space up or down for
exponents and subscripts, and you have no idea what you're doing.
"I'm not going to spend my life flipping that damned carriage up and
down", she said.</p>
<p>Another time Bruno, a well-known mathematician, asked me: "How did
you manage to make your ten lectures at the CBMS conference all the
same length? Isn't it true that some things take longer? When I did
it, some of my talks were 45 minutes, and some 75."</p>
<p>More recently still I asked Calvin, a colleague, "Can you give a
graduate student a ride to this month's Wabash functional analysis
seminar?" "No", he said, "you better get someone else. I've been
away, giving colloquium talks twice this month, and that's enough
travelling."</p>
<p>I didn't make up any of this (except the names). Do you see what
these three stories have in common? To me it's obvious, it jumps to
the eye, and it horrifies me. What Anna, Bruno, and Calvin share and
express is widespread and bad: it's the "me" attitude. It is the
attitude that says "I do only what's important to me, and I am more
important to me than the profession."</p>
<p>I think an automobile transmission mechanic should try to be the
best automobile transmission mechanic he has the talent to be, and
butlers, college presidents, shoe salesmen, and hod-carriers should
aim for perfection in their professions. Try to rise, improve
conditions if you can, and change professions if you must, but as
long as you are a hod-carrier, keep carrying those hods. If you set
out to be a mathematician, you must learn the profession, every part
of it, and then work at it, profess it, live it as best you can. If
you keep asking "what's there in it for me?", you're in the wrong
business. If you're looking for comfort, money, fame, and glory, you
probably won't get them, but if you keep trying to be a
mathematician, you might.</p>
<p>I didn't preach to Calvin, but if I had done so, my sermon would
have said that you support an activity such as the Wabash seminar
(I'll tell more about that seminar later) without even thinking
about it—it's an integral part of professional life. You go to such
seminars the way you get dressed in the morning, nod amiably to an
acquaintance you pass on the street, or brush your teeth before you
go to bed at night. Sometimes you feel like doing it and sometimes
not, but you do it always—it's a part of life and you have no
choice. You don't expect to get rewarded if you do and punished if
you don't, you don't think about it—you just do it.</p>
<p>A professional must know every part of his profession and (we all
hope) like it, and in the profession of mathematics, as in most
others, there are many parts to know. To be a mathematician you have
to know how to be a janitor, a secretary, a businessman, a
conventioneer, an educational consultant, a visiting lecturer, and,
last but not least, in fact above all, a scholar.</p>
<p>As a mathematician you will use blackboards, and you should know
which ones are good and what is the best way and the best time to
clean them. There are many kinds of chalk and erasers; would you
just as soon make do with the worst? At some lecture halls you have
no choice—you must use the overhead projector, and if you don't come
prepared with transparencies, your audience will be in trouble. Word
processors and typewriters, floppy disks and lift-off
ribbons—ignorance is never preferable to bliss. Should you ditto
your preprints, or use mimeograph, or multilith, or xerox? Who
should make decisions about these trivialities—you, or someone who
doesn't care about your stuff at all?</p>
<p>From time to time you'll be asked for advice. A manufacturer will
consult you about the best shape for a beer bottle, a dean will
consult you about the standing of his mathematics department, a
publisher will consult you about the probably sales of a proposed
textbook on fuzzy cohomology. Possibly they will be genteel and not
even mention paying for your service; at other times they will refer
delicately to an unspecified honorarium that will be forthcoming.
Would they treat a surgeon the same way, or an attorney, or an
architect? Would you? Could you?</p>
<p>I am sometimes tempted to tell people that I am a <em>real</em> doctor,
not the medical kind; my education lasted a lot longer than their
lawyer's and cost at least as much; my time and expertise are worth
at least as much as their architect's. In fact, I do not use tough
language, but I've long ago decided not to accept "honoraria" but to
charge fees, carefully spelled out and agreed on in advance. I set
my rates some years back, when I was being asked to review more
textbooks than I had time for. I'd tell the inquiring publisher that
my fee is $1.00 per typewritten page or $50.00 per hour, whichever
comes to less. Sometimes the answer was: "Oh, sorry, we didn't
really want to spend that much", and at other times it was,
matter-of-factly, "O.K., send us your bill along with your report".
The result was that I had less of that sort of work to do and got
paid more respectably for what I still did. My doctor, lawyer, and
architect friends tell me that prices have changed since I
established mine. The time has com, they say, to double the charges.
The answers, they predict, will remain the same: half "no" and half
"sure, of course".</p>
<p>A professional mathematician talks about mathematics at lunch and
at tea. The subject doesn't have to be hot new theorems and proofs
(which can make for ulcers or ecstasy, depending)—it can be a new
teaching twist, a complaint about a fiendish piece of student
skullduggery, or a rumor about an error in the proof of the four
color theorem. At many good universities there is a long-standing
tradition of brown-bag (or faculty club) mathematics lunches, and
they are an important constituent of high quality. They keep the
members of the department in touch with one another; they make it
easy for each to use the brains and the memory of all. At a few
universities I had a hand in establishing the lunch tradition, which
then took root and flourished long after I left.</p>
<p>The pros go to colloquia, seminars, meetings, conferences, and
international congresses—and they use the right word for each. The
pros invite one another to give colloquium talks at their
universities, and the visitor knows—should know—that his duty is not
discharged by one lecture delivered between 4:10 and 5:00 p.m. on
Thursday. The lunch, which gives some of the locals a chance to meet
and have a relaxed conversation with the gues, the possible
specialists' seminar for the in-group at 2:00, the pre-lecture
coffee hour at 3:00, and the post-lecture dinner and evening party
are essential parts of the visitor's job description. It makes for
an exhausting day, but that's how it goes, that's what it means to
be a colloquium lecturer.</p>
<p>Sometimes you are not just a colloquium lecturer, but the "Class of
1909 distinguished Visitor", invited to spend a whole week on the
campus, give two or three mathematics talks and one "general"
lecture, and, in between, mingle, consult, and interact. Some do it
by arriving in time for a Monday afternoon talk, squeezing in a
Tuesday colloquium at a sister university 110 miles down the road,
reappearing for a Wednesday talk and a half of Thursday (spent
mostly with the specialist crony who arranged the visit), and
catching the plane home at 6:05 p.m. Bad show—malfeasance and
nonfeasance—that's not what the idea is at all. When Bombieri came
to Bloomington, I understood much of his first lecture, almost none
of the second, and gave up on the third (answered my mail
instead)—but I got a lot out of his presence. I heard him hold forth
on meromorphic functions at lunch on Monday, explain the Mordell
conjecture over a cup of coffee Wednesday afternoon, and at dinner
Friday evening guess at the probably standing of Euler and Gauss a
hundred years from now. We also talked about clocks and children and
sport and wine. I learned some mathematics and I got a little
insight into what makes one of the outstanding mathematicians of our
time tick. He earned his keep as Distinguished Visitor, not because
he is a great mathematician (that helps!) but because he took the
job seriously. It didn't take his talent to do that; that's
something us lesser people can do too.</p>
<p>Mathematical talent is probably congenital, but aside from that the
most important attribute of a genuine professional mathematician is
scholarship. The scholar is always studying, always ready and eager
to learn. The scholar knows the connections of his specialty with
the subject as a whole; he knows not only the technical details of
his specialty, but its history and its present standing; he knows
about the others who are working on it and how far they have
reached. He knows the literature, and he trusts nobody: he himself
examines the original paper. He acquires firsthand knowledge no only
of its intellectual content, but also of the date of the work, the
spelling of the author's name, and the punctuation of the title; he
insists on getting every detail of every reference absolutely
straight. The scholar tries to be as broad as possible. No one can
know all of mathematics, but the scholar can succeed in knowing the
outline of it all: what are its parts and what are their places in
the whole?</p>
<p>These are the things, some of the things, that go to make up a
pro.</p>
