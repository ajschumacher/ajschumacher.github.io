# The Beginning of Infinity, by Deutsch

I read [this book][] years ago (2017 or earlier) and didn't write it
up at the time, but some of the themes keep coming up.
[Characteristics of good theories][], for one thing. But more so the
fundamental optimism that we can keep going indefinitely. Deutsch is
focused on knowledge, understanding, and explanationsâ€”but perhaps also
for prosperity, as in a post-scarcity "Star Trek" future ([Saadia][],
[Webb][]). Deutsch's thoughts on quantum theory are fun, but the
optimistic worldview may be more valuable.
