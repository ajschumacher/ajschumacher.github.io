# Wise Charlie Mental Models (cards)

These [100 cards][] are kind of cute. They summarize mental models in
the style of [Charlie Munger][]; some are distinct Munger-isms. The
descriptions aren't terribly good and there are errors. I like the
[general idea][], and I like cards; these are mediocre but not bad.
