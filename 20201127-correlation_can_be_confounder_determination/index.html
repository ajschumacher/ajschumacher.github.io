<h1>Correlation can be confounder determination</h1>
<p class="date">Friday November 27, 2020</p>
<p>In a situation of pure confounding (<em>x</em>←<em>z</em>→<em>y</em>) with equivariant
noise, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient">correlation</a> between <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> is the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_determination">coefficient of determination</a> between <em>z</em> and either <em>x</em> or <em>y</em>:
\( r = R^2 \).</p>
<p>I got to thinking about this because of <a href="/20200917-book_of_why/">The Book of Why</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Stoddard_Burks">Burks</a>] computed the direct effect of parental IQ on children's
IQ and found that only 35 percent, or about one-third, of IQ
variation is inherited. In other words, parents with an IQ fifteen
points above average would typically have children five points above
average." (page 306)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That works out if we have a simple data-generating model like this in
<a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a>:</p>
<!-- set.seed(10)  -->

<pre><code class="language-r">z &lt;- rnorm(1000000, sd=1)            # genetics,            variance=1
x &lt;- z + rnorm(1000000, sd=sqrt(2))  # IQ of parents,  adds variance=2 noise
y &lt;- z + rnorm(1000000, sd=sqrt(2))  # IQ of children, adds variance=2 noise
mean(y[0.9 &lt; x & x &lt; 1.1])
## [1] 0.334556</code></pre>

<p>One third of <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> variance is due to <em>z</em>, and when <em>x</em> values
are around 1, average corresponding <em>y</em> value is around 1/3, so that
checks out: regression to the mean.</p>
<p>The genetic contribution <em>z</em> isn't really observable, though. All we
see are <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>. So how do we get the contribution of <em>z</em>?</p>
<p>Both <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> <a href="/20201030-the_variance_sum_law_is_interesting/">have</a> variance 3. If we had a twin study in this
world, we could recover that variance is 2 when genetics is fixed, and
that would let us find that genetics explains 1/3 of variance. But we
don't generally have a twin study.</p>
<p>The common thing to do would be a regression.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">summary(lm(y ~ x))  # (Pulling out one line of output...)
## Multiple R-squared:  0.1114,     Adjusted R-squared:  0.1114</code></pre>

<p>This is usually interpreted as saying that <em>x</em> explains 11% of the
variation of <em>y</em>. That's true enough, but it isn't how much is
explained by <em>z</em>.</p>
<p>The correlation between <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>, however, <em>is</em> how much variance
is explained by <em>z</em>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">cor(x, y)
## [1] 0.3338363</code></pre>

<p>More generally (for non-equivariant noise) the regression coefficient
gives the fraction of variance explained by <em>z</em>. (See also the earlier
estimate illustrating regression to the mean.)</p>
<p>So this is a way of estimating the effect of an unobserved confounder,
which seems to work in this very simple setting. Is this like what
Burks did? Probably her models were not so simple. Is this a special
case of some more general approach?</p>
<p>I don't think I've seen this kind of "method" before; I'd love to see
more elaboration of this kind of idea for estimating impacts of
unobserved variables.</p>

<p>The data-generating model above (and surrounding discussion) requires
suspension of disbelief; it represents some sort of asexual
reproduction, has additional influences on IQ that are entirely
uncorrelated between parents and children, and of course IQ is fraught
as a topic to begin with. Hopefully the statistical considerations are
still visible.</p>
