# Mastering Python, by van Hattem

[Sharma][] from [Packt][] sent me a review copy of the
[second edition][]. I skimmed it, and I like it a lot. It seems like
[van Hattem][] knows his stuff. The book is hugely inclusive and
erudite; you'll almost certainly learn new things. It includes the
[Y combinator][] as an example. It isn't perfect, but it's better than
[Jaworski and Ziadé's book][], I think, and I'll recommend it.
