<h1>Resume dos and don'ts</h1>
<p class="date">Saturday January  8, 2022</p>
<p>I've thought about my resume, I've read <a href="/20220107-tech_resume_inside_out_by_orosz/" title="The Tech Resume Inside Out, by Orosz">a book about resumes</a>, and
I've reviewed hundreds of candidate resumes. Your resume is the first
work product you share with an employer. Make sure it's good. Here's a
collection of resume advice, together with some appalling errors you
wouldn't think people would make—until you see them happen.</p>
<h3>Do this</h3>
<ul>
<li>Consider your audience and what you want them to think about you.</li>
<li>Focus on what you've achieved. Provide <em>evidence</em>, not just claims.<ul>
<li>Use this pattern:
   <a href="https://www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/google-recruiters-say-these-5-resume-tips-including-x-y-z-formula-will-improve-your-odds-of-getting-hired-at-google.html" title="Google Recruiters Say Using the 'X-Y-Z Formula' on Your Resume Will Improve Your Odds of Getting Hired at Google">Accomplished X, as measured by Y, by doing Z.</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="/20200715-communicate_immediately/" title="Communicate Immediately">Communicate immediately.</a> Be direct. Be clear.</li>
<li>Use bullet-points, short sentences, rarely anything longer than one
   line.</li>
<li>Make the document look perfect. Format must be PDF.<ul>
<li>Page layout matters. 1.5 pages is worse than 1 or 2.</li>
<li>If at all possible, use LaTeX.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Don't do this</h3>
<ul>
<li>Do not include these elements (as listed by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/20/remove-these-things-from-your-resume-asap-says-ceo-who-has-read-thousands-of-resumes.html" title="Remove these 7 things from your resume ‘ASAP,’ says CEO who has read more than 1,000 resumes this year">Peter Yang</a>):<ul>
<li>Irrelevant hobbies and interests</li>
<li>Too many soft skills</li>
<li>Your professional headshot</li>
<li>Personal pronouns (As in: “Managed a team,” not “I managed a
   team”)</li>
<li>The wrong kind of email (As in: AOL or Hotmail, etc.)</li>
<li>Your mailing address (if you’re applying out-of-state)</li>
<li>Job positions older than 10 to 15 years</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://algodaily.com/lessons/the-perfect-software-engineering-resume-is-like-a-google-search-result/step-eight-8" title="from: Writing The Perfect Software Engineering Resume Is Like a Google Search Result">No Need For a Global Summary (Don't Have a Summary/Objective Section)</a></li>
<li>Include no errors in content and formatting. (See next section for
   examples.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Resume horror</h3>
<p>Your expertise should be clear from what you've done, not from some
rating scale that you use on yourself. Please no star ratings or “An
asterisk denotes *Expert level” etc.</p>
<p>Don't say “40 Hours/Week” for every job you've worked. Full time
employment is assumed. I'm thinking about resumes for salaried
positions, but even if it were hourly, I don't think I'd want to see
“40 Hours/Week” repeated over and over.</p>
<p>Links and email addresses should not have old-school underlined blue
styling. Control the formatting to make it simple and beautiful.</p>
<p>If you have links in your resume, <em>make sure you know where they go</em>.
I've seen resumes where, presumably because they used somebody else's
resume as a starting point, the link text was updated but the link
still took me to <em>somebody else's</em> LinkedIn and Twitter.</p>
<p>Pay special attention with things you're claiming expertise in: It's
hard to believe you if you say you know “CentOs”—because it's CentOS.</p>
<p>Please get the names of your prior employers correct. There is no “Red
American Cross”—it's “American Red Cross.”</p>
<p>If you are “quick to learn new tools and technics” why have you not
learned how to spell “techniques?”</p>
<p>It's easier to not use color at all than to use it well. Particularly
bad: “Wor” in blue, regular weight, with “k Experience” in bold black.
Why do that?</p>
<p>Almost nobody should include GPA(s) in their resume. Possible
exception: It's perfect, and you've never had a job. Particularly bad:
Including a mediocre GPA for one degree, with GPA then conspicuously
absent for one or more other degrees.</p>
<p>Notice how this actual section from a real resume is
self-contradictory:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Communication – Persuasive communicator, comfortable challenging the
status quo when appropriate, whether to long-standing processes or
to conventional thinking to drive greater efficiencies and outcomes.
Able to adjust communications to a diverse audience to ensure
understanding and clarity. Recognizes the importance of providing
concise, complete visualizations of complex data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Show,_don't_tell" title="Wikipedia: Show, don't tell">Show, don't tell.</a> Words without evidence are only demonstrating
that you can waste time.</p>
<p>Don't use two spaces between sentences. We're using computers.</p>    </article>
