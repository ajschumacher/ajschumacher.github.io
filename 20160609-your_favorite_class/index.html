<h1>Your Favorite Class</h1>
<p class="date">Thursday June  9, 2016</p>
<p>I read a fairly bad <a href="/20160207-talk_like_ted/">book</a> which included this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you think back to your favorite college class, there's a good
chance the professor you most enjoyed injected a fair amount of
humor into his or her presentations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That section was about humor in presentations, but the reference got
me thinking about my own favorite college class, which wasn't
particularly funny.</p>
<p>I couldn't name or even recognize the professor of the class I
remember most strongly. The class was memorable because the professor
wasn't doing the same things other professors did. The professor was
orchestrating the class so that <em>students</em> did things.</p>
<p>This was the first class I recall in which the professor would pose a
question and tell us to turn and talk about it with the people near us
for a solid five minutes, multiple times through a "lecture."</p>
<p>This class had a long reading list from which we chose what we wanted
to read. I read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Agile-Gene-Nature-Turns-Nurture/dp/006000679X">The Agile Gene</a>. I probably thought more about that
book than anything else I read as an undergrad.</p>
<p>In this class we did a group project. My group decided to transcribe
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Guy">Family Guy</a> in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet">International Phonetic Alphabet</a>. It was so
much fun, I'm sure we learned more about the IPA and thought more
about regional dialects than we would have done with a more typical
assignment.</p>
<p>I learned more about teaching techniques like these, which I might
summarize as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student-centred_learning">student-centered</a>, when I studied
<a href="http://www.bard.edu/mat/">teaching at Bard</a>. They were so rare at <a href="http://www.wisc.edu/">my university</a> that it
was shocking when I encountered a class that didn't reduce perfectly
well to a series of videos.</p>
<p>If the most memorable thing about a class is the person teaching it,
that's an indictment of the class, not a recommendation. It certainly
doesn't hurt for a teacher to be charismatic, but it's sad for
students to go through school hoping to encounter super-teachers who
are expert entertainers, as if that's the best or only way to learn.</p>    </article>
