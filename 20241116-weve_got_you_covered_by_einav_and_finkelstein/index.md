# (Audio) We've got you covered, by Einav and Finkelstein

I read [this book][] because Furman recommended it, and his
[description][] is good. I admire the economist authors' ability to
take a normative stand while staying clear-headed about measured
realities. I'm on board.

The central claim of the book is that we _should_ provide free basic
health care to everyone. They support this by arguing that the US has
been _trying_ to do this: trying to honor an implicit social contract.

The issue then is that the US has been doing a very poor job of it.
The authors propose that health insurance should instead be free and
automatic for everyone, with no sign-up hoops or costs incurred for
receiving care.

Problems with the current US system include its complexity itself, and
health insurance being tied to employment (therefore subject to
termination at any time) and medical costs being a potentially
unbounded burden for individuals, sometimes even for those _with_
insurance.

They point out that insurance doesn't actually have that much
influence on health outcomes, because impact on health is dominated by
behaviors that correlate with wealth, for example, and because people
generally still _get_ health care even if not insured, even if it also
saddles them with debt. So universal health insurance won't resolve
disparities in health outcomes. (This does appear somewhat at odds
with the authors' frequent complaint that the US system often pays for
treatment only after conditions become acute dangers, while earlier
treatment might have been cheaper and prevented the worst health
outcomes.)

The book is also full of interesting current and historical detail
about the US and international health systems.

This is part of a section which is a great example of the challenges
of trying to linearize multiple things into one measure. In this case
they were using a ratio of benefits to cost, so a cheap and decent
thing showed up as better than an expensive but essential thing.
