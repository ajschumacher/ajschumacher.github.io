<h1>The Book of Why, by Pearl and Mackenzie</h1>
<p class="date">Thursday September 17, 2020</p>
<p>In <a href="http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/WHY/">The Book of Why</a>, Judea Pearl explains that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judea_Pearl">Judea Pearl</a>'s
work is very important and most statisticians are malicious, fools, or
both. The attempt to popularize his work fails to usefully communicate
his contributions. You're better off reading his <a href="https://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r481.pdf">Seven Tools</a>
paper, which in six pages is more complete than and as instructive as
the book.</p>

<h3><a name="useful"></a>Possibly useful ideas</h3>
<p>The book is about how to answer questions based on data, which is a
topic I'm very interested in. I tried to <a href="/20200912-what_should_be_in_your_regression/">summarize</a> some of the
simplest ideas conveyed, about what variables to control for when
estimating an effect. The book isn't a textbook, but I wish it had
better explained how to implement more sophisticated control
techniques.</p>
<p>Pearl references a <a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/aglynn/files/glynnkashin-frontdoor.pdf">paper</a> whose authors used paired observational
and experimental data, finding that "front-door adjustment" with the
observational data gives a result like that from the experimental
data. That's compelling! How can I use that adjustment?</p>
<p>I also liked the material (starting pages 200 and 309) on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox">Simpson's Paradox</a>.</p>
<p>To be clear, I think the book is trying to offer some useful ideas. I
wish it were more successful in conveying them.</p>
<hr />
<h3><a name="no_causality"></a>Sidestepping causality</h3>
<p>You might think this book is about determining whether something
causes something else, based on data. It is <a href="#hill_guidelines">not</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"... causal questions can never be answered from data alone." (page
351)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite Pearl's finality, there is research on doing just this. It
goes by <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/task/causal-discovery">causal discovery</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_causal_analysis">exploratory causal analysis</a>. In
<a href="http://www.chalearn.org/challenges.html">experiments</a>, some machine learning <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/guyon_isabelle_causality_challenge_final_short_r02.pdf">methods</a> do much better than
chance in identifying known causal relationships. Pearl even advised a
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.2312">related paper</a>. I agree there are epistemological uncertainties in
this field, but it's interesting!</p>
<p>The closest the book comes to model identification are some allusions
to independence tests that can indicate data isn't consistent with a
model (or "Fit Indices" in <a href="https://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r481.pdf">Seven Tools</a>). Pearl's causal models
come from the outside knowledge of humans.</p>
<p>The book also doesn't have much to say on the philosophy of causation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"... I have not attempted to define causation anywhere in this book
..." (page 48)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That isn't quite true, because he does eventually discuss
counterfactual definitions of causality. But for the most part,
causation is given an axiomatic existence and becomes a silent arrow.
<a href="https://youtu.be/36GT2zI8lVA">Feynman</a> is more fun.</p>
<p>The arrows aren't necessarily bad, but the book is so
<a href="#impediments">busy</a> begging for unrelated praise that we don't get a
clear picture of what they're good for.</p>
<hr />
<h3><a name="no_ai"></a>Wishful AI</h3>
<p>Distinctions between statistics, machine learning, and AI can be
murky, but this book has a mostly statistical flavor. Given a causal
model and data, it's possible to estimate (learn) parameters and make
predictions.</p>
<p>As <a href="#no_causality">above</a>, there's no developed mechanism to learn
what the causal graph should be. Systems like
<a href="https://automaticstatistician.com/">The Automatic Statistician</a> do more to discover relationships in
data. Pearl's methods require a human to provide a causal graph.</p>
<p>I quite agree with Pearl that current AI seems too <a href="/20170429-from_behaviorist_to_constructivist_ai/">behaviorist</a>.
Mental models seem important to intelligence. His approach of defining
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_artificial_intelligence">symbolic</a> solution to a class of problems he likes is not a
compelling solution.</p>
<p>Like the proposal of Gary Marcus in The Algebraic Mind, Pearl
<a href="#brain">offers</a> that the symbolic system of his design "must be close
to the way that our brains represent" things (page 269). This is not
clear to me.</p>
<p>I agree that more advanced AI should be able to understand causality.
I'm not sure Pearl's explicit methods will play a part. I further
disagree with him on how <a href="#conversation">communication</a> works, and the
<a href="#chinese_room">Chinese Room</a>.</p>
<hr />
<h3><a name="impediments"></a>Difficulties in reading</h3>
<p>I have to imagine that Pearl is likable in person, but his style here
reads as extreme self-praise and even putting down others to seem
better by comparison. Knowing him only through this book, it's hard to
root for him.</p>
<p>He tilts at straw men, writing as if <a href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/376920/the-book-of-why-by-judea-pearl-why-is-he-bashing-statistics">statisticians</a> and economists
have never thought about causality without his guidance. But
researchers have <a href="https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/Digitization/141324NCJRS.pdf">not</a> been afraid to say things are "most likely a
cause, not just a correlate" even without his work.</p>
<p>To make his work seem more novel, he keeps it at a distance from
<a href="#coefficients">familiar</a> topics, even when only the interpretation is
different, preventing readers from easily connecting with prior
knowledge.</p>
<p>He writes as if he could have more quickly shown a connection between
smoking and lung cancer, but does not support this with evidence or
example of a feasible mechanism. You might disagree with Tufte about
whether data visualization could have prevented the Challenger
disaster, but at least Tufte <a href="https://blogs.stockton.edu/hist4690/files/2012/06/Edward-Tufte-Visual-and-Statistical-Thinking.pdf">shows</a> you the visualization.</p>
<p>In <a href="#interaction1">multiple</a> <a href="#interaction2">places</a>, Pearl says
linear models don't support interactions. There must be an
interpretation of this that is true, but I don't know what it is.
Interactions are commonly modeled with linear models.</p>
<p>I had hoped that with some effort I'd be able to follow the example on
page 83, but as far as I can tell it is incomplete or incorrect. (I
emailed the authors asking for clarification and will update as
appropriate.)</p>
<p>Andrew Gelman's <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2019/01/08/book-pearl-mackenzie/">notes</a> mention some issues with the book. (And some
others are even more <a href="#asylum">glaring</a>.) But also: Sherlock Holmes is
not known for deduction or induction, but for abduction (page 93).
It's not clear why we should change multiple variables on page 279,
but freeze them on page 312.</p>
<p>This book could have been so much better.</p>

<p>"Instead of predicting whether a prisoner is alive or dead, we might
want to predict how much the unemployment rate will go up if we
raise the minimum wage." (page 43)</p>

<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"a philosophical school called positivism, which holds that the
universe is a product of human thought and that science is only a
description of those thoughts." (page 67)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is at best a tortured interpretation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positivism">positivism</a>. Wikipedia
says: "Positivism asserts that all authentic knowledge allows
verification and that all authentic knowledge assumes that the only
valid knowledge is scientific."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Two people who believe in two different causal diagrams can analyze
the same data and may never come to the same conclusion, regardless
of how “big” the data are." (page 90)</p>

<p>"... if you have identified a sufficient set of deconfounders in
your diagram, gathered data on them, and properly adjusted for them,
then you have every right to say that you have computed the causal
effect <em>X</em> ➔ <em>Y</em> (provided, of course, that you can defend your
causal diagram on scientific grounds)." (page 139)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Statisticians have devised ingenius methods for handling this
“curse of dimensionality” problem. Most involve some sort of
extrapolation, whereby a smooth function is fitted to the data and
used to fill in the holes created by the empty strata." (page 221)</p>

<hr />
<p><a name="coefficients"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Regression coefficients, whether adjusted or not, are only
statistical trends, conveying no causal information in themselves.
\( r_{YX.Z} \) represents the causal effect of <em>X</em> on <em>Y</em>, whereas
\( r_{YX} \) does not, exclusively because we have a diagram
showing <em>Z</em> as a confounder of <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em>." (page 223)</p>
<p>"Path coefficients are fundamentally different from regression
coefficients, although they can often be computed from the latter."
(page 223)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"If I were less modest, I would close here with Isaac Newton's
famous saying about “standing on the shoulders of giants.”" (page
244)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is at the close of a section about the work his students have
done. The generous interpretation is that he isn't saying that he's
the giant.</p>

nonexistent worlds separated us from our protohuman ancestors and
indeed from any other creature on the planet." (page 260)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Could structural models, in some shape or form, be the actual
shortcut that we use [in our physical brains]? I think it is very
likely, for two reasons. First, structural causal models are a
shortcut that works, and there aren't any competitors around with
that miraculous property. Second, they were modeled on Bayesian
networks, which in turn were modeled on David Rumelhart's
description of message passing in the brain." (page 268)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Causal diagrams, with their simple rules of following and erasing
arrows, must be close to the way that our brains represent
counterfactuals." (page 269)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Using her data and path analysis, she computed the direct effect of
parental IQ on children's IQ and found that only 35 percent, or
about one-third, of IQ variation is inherited. In other words,
parents with an IQ fifteen points above average would typically have
children five points above average." (page 306)</p>
