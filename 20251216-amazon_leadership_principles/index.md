I don't know any company that's as into a set of principles as Amazon
is. See [Working Backwards][], for example, on how they're deeply
integrated into hiring and performance review processes.

The Leadership Principles started as company core principles in 1998,
part of spreading Amazon culture across newly acquired companies.
("Customer Obsession" might be considered to precede even this list,
as it was sort of a founding ethos of Amazon.)

> Amazon’s purchase of Telebuch in Germany and BookPages in the UK in
> 1998 gave Bezos an opportunity to articulate the company’s core
> principles. Alison Algore, a D. E. Shaw transplant who worked in
> human resources, pondered Amazon’s values with Bezos as he prepared
> for an introductory conference call with the Telebuch founders. They
> agreed on five core values and wrote them down on a whiteboard in a
> conference room: _customer obsession, frugality, bias for action,
> ownership,_ and _high bar for talent._ Later Amazon would add a
> sixth value, innovation. (from [The Everything Store][])

The Leadership Principles appeared with that name at some point in the
early 2000s, though I haven't been able to lock down precise details
on this. It seems they were fairly stable as a list of 13 principles
from the early 2000s until 2015.


Leadership Principle 5 was [added](https://aws.amazon.com/executive-insights/content/leading-and-innovating-with-leadership-principles/) in 2015.


In 2021, Amazon
[added](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/two-new-leadership-principles)
Leadership Principles 15 and 16 as Andy Jassy was becoming CEO.

It sounds like teams at Amazon also often have around five or six
"[tenets][]," which are about what the team aims to be and do. This
[article][] includes Amazon HR's tenets, for example.

That same [article][] has a list of ways that Amazon is peculiar, in
their parlance. (There's a mascot named [Peccy][]!)
