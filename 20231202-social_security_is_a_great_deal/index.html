<h1>Social Security is a great deal</h1>
<p class="date">Saturday December  2, 2023</p>
<p>Social Security in its current form pays out, with no volatility, a
perpetual inflation-adjusted annual yield of up to 51% on what
individuals pay in tax. (15% is common, and 5% is the worst you can
get.) No investment is as good as Social Security.</p>
<p>I know it's not really an individual investment; younger Americans are
supposed to be supporting older ones and so on. But I had no idea how
good Social Security is for recipients, relative to how much they put
in.</p>
<p>Social Security pays out a percentage of your income. In monthly
terms, it's 90% of up to $1,115/month, then 32% up to $6,721/month,
then 15% up to $13,350/month. These are 2023 dollars and give the
maximum full retirement age monthly payment of $3,792.</p>
<p>Full retirement age for me is 67. If I start collecting Social
Security early, at 62, payments are locked in at 70% of the “full”
value. If instead I delay until 70, payments are 124%.</p>
<p>Social Security is based on inflation-adjusted income over your 35
highest-earning years. (If you're working your 36th year and earning
no more than any other year, this calculation won't apply.)</p>
<p>The last factor we need is the 6.2% tax you pay in to Social Security.
Your employer also separately pays as much, but most people don't
consider that part of their income.</p>
<p>So the best “return” you can get is if you have lifetime earnings so
far under $468,300 and you plan to start collecting Social Security as
late as possible:</p>
<pre><code>0.9 * 1.24 / 35 / 0.062  # 51.4%</code></pre>

<p>The worst non-zero return you can get is if your lifetime Social
Security earnings are already over $2.8M and you plan to collect
Social Security as soon as possible.</p>
<pre><code>0.15 * 0.7 / 35 / 0.062  # 4.8%</code></pre>

<p>A conservative mid-career value is likely about 15%.</p>
<pre><code>0.32 * 1.0 / 35 / 0.062  # 14.7%</code></pre>

<p>Social Security adjusts for inflation, so these are all returns <em>over</em>
inflation. I just can't think of anything that gets returns like this.</p>
<p>You get the same return on your last year's contribution before
collecting, so comparative investments can't really be allowed <em>any</em>
time for compounding. Still, most contributions will sit for some time
before the contributor starts collecting, so a full comparison could
be more complicated.</p>
<p>Social Security is less flexible than an investing account. But is
there <em>anything</em> that comes close to delivering what Social Security
does, for someone who lives to be 90, say?</p>
<hr />
<p>The calculations above may seem opaque. I simplified a little,
dropping things that cancel out. More explicitly:</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">($100 new income this year / 35 years considered)
 * 90% income replacement factor
 * 1.24 late start factor
 = annual Social Security benefit from income
-------------------------------------------------------
($100 new income this year * 6.2% tax = tax paid on income)</code></pre>

<p>I rearranged terms a little, and I'm still leaving out conversion
to/from monthly basis which is just a distraction.</p>    </article>
