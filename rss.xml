<title>Scouting America Oath and Law</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<h3>Scout Oath</h3>
<p>On my honor I will do my best to do my duty to God and my country and to obey the Scout Law; to help other people at all times; to keep myself physically strong, mentally awake, and morally straight.</p>
<h3>Scout Law</h3>
<p>A Scout is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trustworthy</li>
<li>Loyal</li>
<li>Helpful</li>
<li>Friendly</li>
<li>Courteous</li>
<li>Kind</li>
<li>Obedient</li>
<li>Cheerful</li>
<li>Thrifty</li>
<li>Brave</li>
<li>Clean</li>
<li>Reverent</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scout_Law">Since</a> 1907 and 1908 with the writings of Seton and Baden-Powell,
there have been many forms and evolutions of Scout Laws. The version
here is <a href="https://www.scouting.org/about/faq/question10/">current</a> for Scouting America (formerly Boy Scouts of
America) and somewhat distinctive in its focus on single words.
(Explanatory sentences are also included but omitted above.)</p>
<p>Here's Baden-Powell's 1911 <a href="http://www.netpages.free-online.co.uk/sha/law.htm">version</a>:</p>
<h3>Promise</h3>
<p>On my honour I promise that I will do my best:</p>
<ol>
<li>To do my duty to God and the King.</li>
<li>To help other people at all times.</li>
<li>To obey the Scout Law.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Law</h3>
<ol>
<li>A Scout's honour is to be trusted.</li>
<li>A Scout is Loyal to the King, and to his officers, and to his
   country, and to his employers.</li>
<li>A Scout's duty is to be useful and to help others.</li>
<li>A Scout is a friend to all and a brother to every other scout no
   matter to what social class the other belongs.</li>
<li>A Scout is Courteous.</li>
<li>A Scout is a friend to animals.</li>
<li>A Scout obeys orders of his patrol leader or scoutmaster without
   question.</li>
<li>A Scout smiles and whistles under all difficulties.</li>
<li>A Scout is thrifty.</li>
<li>A Scout is clean in thought, word and deed.</li>
</ol>

<title>Christian Beatitudes</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<ul>
<li>Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of
   heaven.</li>
<li>Blessed are they who mourn, for they will be comforted.</li>
<li>Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the land.</li>
<li>Blessed are they who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they
   will be satisfied.</li>
<li>Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.</li>
<li>Blessed are the clean of heart, for they will see God.</li>
<li>Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of
   God.</li>
<li>Blessed are they who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness,
   for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</li>
</ul>
<p>These eight verses are Matthew 5:3-10 in the NABRE (New American Bible
Revised Edition) translation used in Catholic churches in the US, and
the most famous part of the Sermon on the Mount delivered by Jesus.</p>
<p>"Beatitude" is from a word meaning "blessed" and not any breakdown
like "be" followed by "attitude." Interpretations vary, with at least
<a href="https://openthebible.org/article/the-beatitudes-of-jesus-explained/">one</a> being that the Beatitudes are not just reports about who is
blessed but a step-by-step guide to becoming more blessed.</p>

<title>Buddhist Noble Eightfold Path</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<ol>
<li>Right understanding (Samma ditthi)</li>
<li>Right thought (Samma sankappa)</li>
<li>Right speech (Samma vaca)</li>
<li>Right action (Samma kammanta)</li>
<li>Right livelihood (Samma ajiva)</li>
<li>Right effort (Samma vayama)</li>
<li>Right mindfulness (Samma sati)</li>
<li>Right concentration (Samma samadhi)</li>
</ol>
<p>Buddhism has Four Noble Truths: There is suffering, suffering is
caused by desire, freedom from suffering can come from ending desire,
and the path to do this is the Noble Eightfold Path.</p>
<p>English versions vary; I like the version quoted above which comes
from <a href="https://tricycle.org/magazine/noble-eightfold-path/">Tricycle</a>. Interpretations vary somewhat as well, but one
reading is as a step-by-step guide.</p>

<title>Quaker Testimonies</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<ul>
<li>Simplicity</li>
<li>Peace</li>
<li>Integrity (Truth)</li>
<li>Community</li>
<li>Equality</li>
<li>Stewardship</li>
</ul>
<p>Quakers are interesting. The list here is the SPICES list of
Testimonies, or values, which appears for example on the
<a href="https://www.quakersdc.org/quaker-values">DC Quakers site</a>. A list of four items (Simplicity, Truth,
Equality, Peace) is also common, for example appearing on the
<a href="https://www.quaker.org.uk/faith/read-about-quaker-faith">UK Quakers site</a>.</p>
<p>As the two versions suggest, Quakers don't have to agree on much.
Different "Yearly Meetings" put together their own books. Here's a
selection from the <a href="https://www.bym-rsf.org/file_download/inline/281d7f8f-f578-4b0a-baeb-8ab753a30320">Faith and Practice</a> of the Baltimore Yearly
Meeting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Baltimore Yearly Meeting has no binding creed. Its principles of
belief are based on its Judeo-Christian heritage and adherence to
the Spirit of Christ (the Inward Light, the Divine Seed, That of God
in Everyone). The testimonies spring from respect for truth; for
peace, harmony, and a settled intention to practice love; for
simplicity, community, and the equal worth of all people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No fixed list of Testimonies, then, is official. Some Quaker Friends
even <a href="https://www.friendsjournal.org/categorically-not-the-testimonies/">object</a> to them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Human beings need words to communicate. But when we codify, make
creeds, and canonize a few words, we limit our vision, as well as
the possibility of God’s work through us. Walking away from such
deified virtues, where might we go instead? What if we were to start
with fresh, personal experiences and then shared them in a manner
that was as mediated as little as possible by advance expectations?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's an interesting and characteristically Quaker objection.</p>

<title>Noise, by Kahneman, Sibony, and Sunstein</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p><a href="/2011/12/17/selections-from-and-thoughts-on/">Thinking, Fast and Slow</a> was about bias, and now <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise:_A_Flaw_in_Human_Judgment">Noise</a> is about
variance. It even opens with the classic two-by-two accuracy and
precision bullseye <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias%E2%80%93variance_tradeoff#Motivation">illustration</a>. But the book is really about how
people are systematically different from one another. The book
considers federated systems in which work items are assigned to
different people, and concludes that most of the "variance" comes from
stable differences between those people.</p>
<p><img alt="breakdown" src="breakdown.jpg"></p>
<p>(I am a fan of the <a href="/20201030-the_variance_sum_law_is_interesting/">variance sum law</a>.)</p>
<p>In the book's phrasing, "system noise" is variance in outcomes,
distinct from bias. System noise is the sum of "level noise," which is
stable differences in average outcomes per person - "strict judge vs.
lenient judge" - and "stable pattern noise," which is stable
differences in how individuals are overfit, in the ML sense, - "Bob's
generally strict but always lenient with young mothers" - and
"occasion noise," which is true repeat-performance noise based on
randomness from somewhere (conditions, etc.).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>while the existence of occasion noise is surprising and even
disturbing, there is no indication that within-person variability is
larger than between-person differences. The most important component
of system noise is the one we had initially neglected: stable
pattern noise, the variability among judges in their judgments of
particular cases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Note also that "level noise" can be properly thought of as just an
average over "pattern noise" - I'm not sure it's correct to treat it
separately.)</p>
<p>The challenge, not sufficiently addressed, in my opinion, is that
removing this "noise" requires not just choosing one answer to be the
right one, but convincing the people involved. This is a societal
challenge. Whatever level of strictness or leniency you choose, for
the judges, some judges will disagree.</p>
<p>I think Kahneman neglects the extent to which systems exist through
false consensus: It isn't possible to get everyone to agree on the
details, so the system has to be made vague enough that everyone can
<em>think</em> it says what they want. Then they can go on having differences
of opinion.</p>
<p>Not that this is good, exactly. It's politics.</p>
<p>And Kahneman does talk about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Na%C3%AFve_realism_(psychology)">naïve realism</a> and the illusion of
agreement, so this idea isn't totally absent from the book. But just
like hand-washing took (and takes) surprisingly much effort, there's a
big gap between <em>having</em> a Gawande-style checklist and getting it
accepted and followed, for example.</p>
<p>There were interesting bits about how groups can have opposite
effects: Averaging independent outcomes can decrease noise, but
discussion can actually amplify noise. They recommend techniques like
"estimate-talk-estimate" to try to get positive effects.</p>
<p>Kahneman also emphasizes "percent concordant" and always includes it
with correlation coefficients. This is exactly the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_of_superiority">Common Language Effect Size</a> which goes by many names. I'm a fan!
Glad to have Kahneman supporting this here. It sure would be nice if
it went from zero to one though.</p>
<p>Another interesting topic is what Kahneman calls “objective ignorance”
and is very tightly related to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes_error_rate">Bayes error rate</a> or
"irreducible error." It made me wonder, when we're talking about
variance explained, if 60% is "irreducible," then maybe explaining 20%
is quite a strong result, actually. Unclear how to be quite confident
about this kind of thing though. Bad news for <a href="/20200714-foundation_trilogy/">psychohistory</a> too.
(How much is chaos?)</p>
<p>Kahneman chastises people for feeling they're 80% confident about a
given decision if they'll only be right 60% of the time. But there's a
difference he ignores, I think: You could be 80% confident that you
made the best possible decision given your information at the time,
and still be right just 60% of the time. Those can be consistent.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/sds/docs/dawes/the-robust-beauty-of-improper-linear-models-in-decision-making.pdf">The Robust Beauty of Improper Linear Models in Decision Making</a>
(just give everything equal weight) is interesting. I wonder whether
some big chunk of AI "success" will essentially come from this kind of
effect, just the benefit of statistical instead of clinical judgement,
but the fanciness of AI will make it more palatable.</p>
<p>There's bits on incorporating the base rate, which feels like being
Bayesian. Don't overfit, etc. And be actively open-minded.</p>
<p>What is the right way to average predictions of superforecasters? Is
it just simple arithmetic mean? Or is it some other mean that works
best?</p>
<p>Long ago I was in a start-up that didn't do annual performance
reviews. I thought it was radical and great. So it was interesting to
hear that apparently more companies are moving away from annual
performance reviews.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And if your goal is to bring out the best in people, you can
reasonably ask whether measuring individual performance and using
that measurement to motivate people through fear and greed is the
best approach (or even an effective one).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The book finishes out with some discussion of rules vs. standards,
where rules are more mechanical and standards still allow some
discussion while being more prescriptive than just principles.</p>
<p><img alt="cover" src="cover.jpg"></p>
<h3>Six principles of decision hygiene</h3>
<ol>
<li>The goal of judgment is accuracy, not individual expression.</li>
<li>Think statistically, and take the outside view of the case.</li>
<li>Structure judgments into several independent tasks.</li>
<li>Resist premature intuitions.</li>
<li>Obtain independent judgments from multiple judges, then consider
aggregating those judgments.</li>
<li>Favor relative judgments and relative scales.</li>

<title>The Psychology of Money, by Housel</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>Housel had a <a href="https://collabfund.com/blog/the-psychology-of-money/">blog post</a> in 2018, and it was big enough that it
became a <a href="https://planetone.online/downloads/others/books/The_Psychology_of_Money.pdf">book</a> in 2020. It's wild how many books come about that
way now; it's like your proposal has to go viral before you get a book
deal.</p>
<p>The blog post and book are structured similarly <em>enough</em> that I think
it's interesting to compare them.</p>
<p>The blog post was a list of 20 items. I think 7 of them don't really
appear in the book at all, perhaps because they're too wonky or
specific:</p>
<ul>
<li>(9) Attachment to social proof in a field that demands contrarian
   thinking to achieve above-average results.</li>
<li>(10) An appeal to academia in a field that is governed not by clean
   rules but loose and unpredictable trends.</li>
<li>(12) A tendency toward action in a field where the first rule of
   compounding is to never interrupt it unnecessarily.</li>
<li>(15) An attachment to financial entertainment due to the fact that
   money is emotional, and emotions are revved up by argument, extreme
   views, flashing lights, and threats to your wellbeing.</li>
<li>(17) A preference for skills in a field where skills don’t matter
   if they aren’t matched with the right behavior.</li>
<li>(19) Political beliefs driving financial decisions, influenced by
   economics being a misbehaved cousin of politics.</li>
<li>(20) The three-month bubble: Extrapolating the recent past into the
   near future, and then overestimating the extent to which whatever
   you anticipate will happen in the near future will impact your
   future.</li>
</ul>
<p>The book, then, has 18 items: 13 from the blog post's list, and 5 that
are new (at least new as whole sections). The book has an intro, and
two other chapters in which are a summary and a breakdown of the
author's personal money choices, and then there's a postscript with
his "brief history of why the U.S. consumer thinks the way they do,"
which is something like "after WWII people got used to a little bit of
equality and a little bit of debt, and now they're using too much debt
to try to get back a little bit of equality".</p>
<p>Here are the book's chapters, with blog equivalents (original blog
post numbering in parens) and notes:</p>
<ol>
<li>No One's Crazy: Your personal experiences with money make up maybe
   0.00000001% of what's happened in the world, but maybe 80% of how
   you think the world works.<ul>
<li>(5) Anchored-to-your-own-history bias: Your personal experiences
  make up maybe 0.00000001% of what’s happened in the world but
  maybe 80% of how you think the world works.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Luck &amp; Risk: Nothing is as good or as bad as it seems.<ul>
<li>(1) Earned success and deserved failure fallacy: A tendency to
  underestimate the role of luck and risk, and a failure to
  recognize that luck and risk are different sides of the same
  coin.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Never Enough: When rich people do crazy things.<ul>
<li>This is the first new section, and it's about greed, in fairly
  extreme cases where successful people were found to have
  committed fraud even when you wouldn't think they'd need to. I
  think the section has noble intent but fails because (a) you
  have to believe that these people's <em>earlier</em> success was
  non-fraudulent, which is suspect (Madoff's earlier "success" was
  based on payment for order flow, it seems, which is illegal in
  Canada and disliked by many in the US) and (b) the general theme
  of avarice need not go so far as fraud to be worthwhile. See,
  for example, <a href="/20251123-your_money_or_your_life/">Your money or your life</a>. On the other hand,
  maybe it's easier to talk about greed with extreme cases so that
  the reader can safely revile them without finding them familiar.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Confounding Compounding: $81.5 billion of Warren Buffett's $84.5
   billion net worth came after his 65th birthday. Our minds are not
   built to handle such absurdities.<ul>
<li>(8) Underappreciating the power of compounding, driven by the
  tendency to intuitively think about exponential growth in linear
  terms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Getting Wealthy vs. Staying Wealthy: Good investing is not
   necessarily about making good decisions. It's about consistently
   not screwing up.<ul>
<li>(16) Optimism bias in risk-taking, or “Russian Roulette should
  statistically work” syndrome: An over attachment to favorable
  odds when the downside is unacceptable in any circumstance.</li>
<li>This one is tangled up with 13, and indeed includes "the most
  important part of every plan is to plan on the plan not going
  according to plan" here too. The distinction, perhaps, is about
  not actively <em>doing</em> things that risk ruining you, as opposed to
  defensively <em>protecting yourself</em> from outside forces ruining
  you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tails, You Win: You can be wrong half the time and still make a
   fortune.<ul>
<li>This is a new one, about making lots of bets. Assuming no bet
  can kill you, you only need a minority of them to do really well
  in order to win.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Freedom: Controlling your time is the highest dividend money pays.<ul>
<li>This appeared in the blog post in passing ("A key use of wealth
  is using it to control your time") but it's grown into a whole
  section and maybe even a theme in the book.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Man in the Car Paradox: No one is impressed with your possessions
   as much as you are.<ul>
<li>(3) Rich man in the car paradox</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Wealth is What You Don't See: Spending money to show people how
   much money you have is the fastest way to have less money.<ul>
<li>(11) The social utility of money coming at the direct expense of
  growing money; wealth is what you don’t see.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Save Money: The only factor you can control generates one of the
    only things that matters. How wonderful.<ul>
<li>Also new, and quite explicitly advice.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reasonable &gt; Rational: Aiming to be mostly reasonable works better
    than trying to be coldly rational.<ul>
<li>There's some of the "avoid Russian roulette" idea here, but this
  is mostly new... It's a little bit like how the "snowball
  method" of paying off small debts first is often a bad idea
  financially - unless doing it that way makes the difference
  between paying off debt and not doing so. Also sort of related
  to the idea of knowing the price of things: there can be a
  psychological price, which can be meaningful for an individual.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Surprise! History is the study of change, ironically used as a map
    of the future.<ul>
<li>(6) Historians are Prophets fallacy: Not seeing the irony that
  history is the study of surprises and changes while using it as
  a guide to the future. An overreliance on past data as a signal
  to future conditions in a field where innovation and change is
  the lifeblood of progress.</li>
<li>Vonnegut: “History is merely a list of surprises,' I said. 'It
  can only prepare us to be surprised yet again. Please write that
  down.” Housel has written it down.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Room for Error: The most important part of every plan is planning
    on your plan not going according to plan.<ul>
<li>(13) Underestimating the need for room for error, not just
  financially but mentally and physically.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You'll Change: Long-term planning is harder than it seems because
    people's goals and desires change over time.<ul>
<li>(4) A tendency to adjust to current circumstances in a way that
  makes forecasting your future desires and actions difficult,
  resulting in the inability to capture long-term compounding
  rewards that come from current decisions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Nothing's Free: Everything has a price, but not all prices appear
    on labels.<ul>
<li>(2) Cost avoidance syndrome: A failure to identify the true
  costs of a situation, with too much emphasis on financial costs
  while ignoring the emotional price that must be paid to win a
  reward.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You &amp; Me: Beware taking financial cues from people playing a
    different game than you are.<ul>
<li>(14) A tendency to be influenced by the actions of other people
  who are playing a different financial game than you are.</li>
<li>He's talking about bubbles. People driving up bubbles are not
  long-term investors, he says.</li>
</ul>

about Danny than his ability to detonate what we had just done,”
Zweig wrote. He and Kahneman could work endlessly on a chapter, but:</p>
<p>The next thing you know, [Kahneman] sends a version so utterly
transformed that it is unrecognizable: It begins differently, it
ends differently, it incorporates anecdotes and evidence you never
would have thought of, it draws on research that you’ve never heard

<p>We’re so far committed to the independence camp that we’ve done
things that make little sense on paper. We own our house without a
mortgage, which is the worst financial decision we’ve ever made but
the best money decision we’ve ever made. Mortgage interest rates
were absurdly low when we bought our house. Any rational advisor
would recommend taking advantage of cheap money and investing extra
savings in higher-return assets, like stocks. But our goal isn’t to
be coldly rational; just psychologically reasonable.</p>
<p>The independent feeling I get from owning our house outright far
exceeds the known financial gain I’d get from leveraging our assets
with a cheap mortgage. Eliminating the monthly payment feels better
than maximizing the long-term value of our assets. It makes me feel
independent. I don’t try to defend this decision to those pointing
out its flaws, or those who would never do the same. On paper it’s
defenseless. But it works for us. We like it. That’s what matters.
Good decisions aren’t always rational. At some point you have to
choose between being happy or being “right.”</p>

<p>Lots more detail on <a href="https://www.amazon.jobs/content/en/our-workplace/leadership-principles">Amazon's page</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Former:</p>
<ul>
<li>Innovation (added to the initial core principles, circa 1998)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>I don't know any company that's as into a set of principles as Amazon
is. See <a href="/20210903-working_backwards_by_bryar_and_carr/">Working Backwards</a>, for example, on how they're deeply
integrated into hiring and performance review processes.</p>
<p>The Leadership Principles started as company core principles in 1998,
part of spreading Amazon culture across newly acquired companies.
("Customer Obsession" might be considered to precede even this list,
as it was sort of a founding ethos of Amazon.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amazon’s purchase of Telebuch in Germany and BookPages in the UK in
1998 gave Bezos an opportunity to articulate the company’s core
principles. Alison Algore, a D. E. Shaw transplant who worked in
human resources, pondered Amazon’s values with Bezos as he prepared
for an introductory conference call with the Telebuch founders. They
agreed on five core values and wrote them down on a whiteboard in a
conference room: <em>customer obsession, frugality, bias for action,
ownership,</em> and <em>high bar for talent.</em> Later Amazon would add a
sixth value, innovation. (from <a href="https://prachititg.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/the-everything-store-jeff-bezos-and-the-age-of-amazon.pdf">The Everything Store</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Leadership Principles appeared with that name at some point in the
early 2000s, though I haven't been able to lock down precise details
on this. It seems they were fairly stable as a list of 13 principles
from the early 2000s until 2015.</p>
<p>Leadership Principle 5 was <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/executive-insights/content/leading-and-innovating-with-leadership-principles/">added</a> in 2015.</p>
<p>In 2021, Amazon
<a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/two-new-leadership-principles">added</a>
Leadership Principles 15 and 16 as Andy Jassy was becoming CEO.</p>
<hr>
<p>It sounds like teams at Amazon also often have around five or six
"<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5raEKA57PMY">tenets</a>," which are about what the team aims to be and do. This
<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90334069/these-are-amazons-38-rules-for-success">article</a> includes Amazon HR's tenets, for example.</p>
<p>Amazon often accompanies tenets with the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/enterprise-strategy/tenets-supercharging-decision-making/">phrase</a> "unless you know
better ones," which is a neat way of trying to keep them evolving.</p>
<hr>
<p>That same <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90334069/these-are-amazons-38-rules-for-success">article</a> has a list of ways that Amazon is peculiar, in
their parlance. (There's a mascot named <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90329525/amazon-peccy">Peccy</a>!)</p>

<title>(Audio) Your money or your life, by Robin and Dominguez</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p><a href="https://files.addictbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Your-Money-or-Your-Life.pdf">This</a> is the 2018 revised edition, not the 1992 original, but it's
still arguably the antecedent to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIRE_movement">FIRE</a> (Financial Independence,
Retire Early) movement and now even features a foreword from
<a href="https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/">Mr. Money Mustache</a>. It's a nine-step program.</p>
<ol>
<li>Figure out how much money you've earned in your whole life, and
   your current net worth.</li>
<li>Figure out your "real hourly wage," and track all your income and
   spending.</li>
<li>Catalog monthly spending into custom categories for you.</li>
<li>Evaluate how you feel about your spending, by category.</li>
<li>Make a monthly chart tracking your income and spending.</li>
<li>Minimize spending.</li>
<li>Maximize income.</li>
<li>Accumulate money toward a crossover point where you can live on
   investment income.</li>
<li>Invest in fairly boring ways to generate income you can live on.</li>
</ol>
<p>It's reasonable advice and I generally agree. I was a little surprised
by the extent to which the book is really "degrowth," in the sense of
<a href="/20240519-survival_of_the_richest_by_rushkoff/">Rushkoff</a>. It's really not about "fat FIRE," but about
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_living">simple living</a>, or voluntary simplicity, not just as an expedient
for retirement, but as a moral-environmental imperative.</p>
<p>I liked how <a href="/20241116-weve_got_you_covered_by_einav_and_finkelstein/">We've got you covered</a> was very clear about the
decision inherent in health insurance about what to cover versus not
cover. This book is clear about the decision regarding how much is
"enough" spending for life in general.</p>
<p>I think the choice about how much is "enough" is interesting as a
personal choice, and also an interesting topic in connection with
<a href="/20240921-fully_automated_luxury_communism_by_bastani/">Fully Automated Luxury Communism</a>. (What level of luxury?) I don't
think this figure ("The Fulfillment Curve") is super great though:</p>
<p><img src="fulfillment.jpg" width="480px"></p>
<p>The justification in the text is that people report similar
"fulfillment" across a wide range of incomes, and that at some point
you get more "clutter" than real fulfillment. I don't think it's
<em>completely</em> wrong, but it's close. I feel like there could be
something here about finding fulfillment in better ways, living in
community and participating in the work that supports that community,
equality being healthier than subjugation of the poor by the rich,
that kind of thing. But at the very least this kind of claim needs
more evidence and fewer headstones tossed on the graph.</p>
<p>It's a fine book with a distinct voice. It talks about "consciousness"
and "life energy" constantly. It says that since you spend time
earning money, money is equivalent with "life energy," which kind of
works in the framework of the book but doesn't raise to the next
natural level, as a critique of the conditions of capitalism.</p>
<p>The author is also into "<a href="http://conversationcafe.org/">conversation café</a>s," which seem like they
could be neat.</p>

<title>(Audio) Breakneck, by Dan Wang</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>It's about China as contrasted with the US, mostly via critiques as in
<a href="/20251120-abundance_klein_thompson/">Abundance</a>. The US is "the lawyerly society" and China is "the
engineering state," and while the one child and zero covid policies
are criticized (for example) the eventual recommendation is to be more
like China, more like Robert Moses.</p>
<hr>
<p>I learned about China's "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Party_(China)">Industrial Party</a>," which is interesting.
Sort of techno-optimism as a nationalist prescription.</p>
<p>Does anybody else remember Vonnegut's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slapstick_(novel)">Slapstick</a>? In which "Western
civilization is nearing collapse as oil runs out, and the Chinese are
making vast leaps forward by miniaturizing themselves and training
groups of hundreds to think as one. Eventually, the miniaturization
proceeds to the point that the Chinese become so small they cause a
plague among those who accidentally inhale them, ultimately destroying
Western civilization beyond repair."</p>
<hr>
<p>There's some interesting stuff about process knowledge and encouraging
communities of practice. I don't know whether this is what makes
Shenzhen successful, or whether the lack of it is what's troubled
Boeing, but I agree that process knowledge is <em>something</em> and that
it's too often ignored or undervalued.</p>
<p>Is Boeing's problem really loss of process knowledge, or is the
problem too much belief in the Friedman doctrine, too much blind focus
on near-term profit?</p>
<hr>
<p>I tried to find where Heidegger said that philosophy was dying, to be
replaced with cybernetics, and it seems to be
<a href="https://grattoncourses.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/22the-end-of-philosophy-and-the-task-of-thinking22.pdf">The End of Philosophy and the Task of Thinking</a>. How could anyone
ever be taken seriously who wrote like this?</p>
<hr>
<p><img alt="cover" src="cover.jpg"></p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Only a country ruled by engineers could be so single-minded about
pursuing a number. (page 123)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This reminds me of <a href="/20200425-tyranny_of_metrics_by_muller/">The Tyranny of Metrics</a>, and the kind of cynical
"data driven" perversions you can find in industry.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>In the United States, physics and mathematics PhDs hardly have a
chance to consider working in their field before a tech giant or
hedge fund picks them up at the sidelines of a conference, flashes
them with a humongous pay package, and folds these eager minds into
their glamorous embrace. Senior government advisers have more or
less stated that Beijing intends to block these temptations. Yao
Yang, a dean at Peking University, has remarked with satisfaction
that salaries have fallen in the financial industry after regulators
imposed a salary cap of $400,000 on the financial sector. Its idea,
Yao said, “is to reduce the attractiveness of finance and to
increase the development of manufacturing.” (page 162)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This reminds me of Jeff Hammerbacher's quote, "The best minds of my
generation are thinking about how to make people click ads. That
sucks."</p>

<title>(Audio) Abundance, by Klein and Thompson</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>I started listening to Dunkelman's <a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/marc-j-dunkelman/why-nothing-works/9781541700215/">Why Nothing Works</a>, but
abandoned it. Ezra Klein's name, I think, is why I made it through the
similar <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abundance_(Klein_and_Thompson_book)">Abundance</a>. Crazy culturally mediated world.</p>
<p>I was very pleased that Klein explicitly references
<a href="/20240921-fully_automated_luxury_communism_by_bastani/">Fully Automated Luxury Communism</a>. <a href="https://wwnorton.com/books/9781324106036">Breakneck</a> turns out to be
substantially similar to Abundance as well, and references it. The
general vibe has been in the air.</p>
<p>The vibe is: Regulate less, build more. Less restriction, more
expansion. Less red tape, more research.</p>
<p>This requires giving government more room to act, which makes sense if
the government is going to do the right things. Power is needed to do
big things, but its tendency to corrupt may still be an issue.</p>
<p>Some interesting references: <a href="https://homelessnesshousingproblem.com/">Homelessness is a housing problem.</a>
<a href="https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/">WTF Happened In 1971?</a> Apparently the US has four times as many
lawyers per capita as France.</p>
<p>There are hints of <a href="/20221105-why_greatness_cannot_be_planned_by_stanley_and_lehman/">Why greatness cannot be planned</a> in Thompson's
second half on science and technology. It makes me wonder about the
limits of fully federated action, as opposed to central control. What
truly requires the power of a government, a university?</p>
<p><img alt="cover" src="cover.jpg"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just as feudalism blocked production that only capitalism could
unleash, so did capitalism constrain an abundance that a new
paradigm might unleash. Core to this analysis of the economy was an
idea that has come to be called the “fettering of production.” Marx
observed that many companies’ obsession with profit kept the entire
economy from exploring ideas that threatened incumbent margins or
failed to produce immediate returns. Among capitalism’s many sins,
Marx wrote, was that it prevented the most wondrous and useful
technology from being invented and deployed in the first place. An
economy run amok with useless fettering serves the rich few at the
expense of the poorer many. (page 127)</p>

<title>Radically condensed instructions for being just as you are</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>This funny little <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/165080210/Radically-Condensed-Instructions-for-Bei-Matthews-J-Jennifer">book</a> was mentioned in <a href="/20250921-four_thousand_weeks_by_burkeman/">Four Thousand Weeks</a>.
It's on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondualism">nonduality</a>. The title joke seems to be that usually people
say even more, writing on this topic, when arguably not much needs to
be said. There are still pretty many words here, and many of them are
"poignancy."</p>
<p>My personal philosophy has some affinity with this nondualism stuff.
My starting point is that experience is the only thing we have direct
experience of. Nondualists seem to argue that this should be both
starting point and ending point. I'm all about living in the moment
and all, but I tend to feel that just because we can't prove things
exist, it doesn't mean we shouldn't believe that they do. But it's
okay to grant that this is a leap.</p>
<p>There's some cute discussion of how trying too hard to live in the
moment is a good way to take yourself out of the moment. I think this
is kind of like falling asleep: trying to make yourself fall asleep is
stressful. You have to relax, and again, you don't relax by trying
hard to relax. Also like meditating, where you aim to let thoughts
come and let them go, not by trying hard to do this, but by not
trying. So we have a "philosophy of not-philosophy," and a perfect
practitioner doesn't need to read this book. I'm not sure the
comparison is perfect, but it reminds me of Star Wars: "I don't know;
fly casual."</p>
<p>Thinking about this more, I wonder if what <a href="/20250921-four_thousand_weeks_by_burkeman/">Four Thousand Weeks</a> is
really trying to offer is a time management of not-time-management.
The idea that you shouldn't be trying to manage time, but that you
should be living and doing things without worrying about the time
management. I think there's something here: getting in the flow of
doing something, not focusing on planning but on doing, etc. This
feels like a better interpretation of <a href="/20250921-four_thousand_weeks_by_burkeman/">Four Thousand Weeks</a> than I
had previously given it. (Maybe better than it really deserves...)</p>
<p>Anyway, sure, cute short book.</p>

<title>Four Thousand Weeks, by Burkeman</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<blockquote>
<p>“You could think of this book as an extended argument for the
empowering potential of giving up hope.” (page 231)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Burkeman's subtitle is "Time Management for Mortals," but the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Thousand_Weeks:_Time_Management_for_Mortals">book</a>
is mostly (though not entirely) opposed to time management. Some
advice is decent, but the core focus on mortality is dead on arrival.
The book is fairly incoherent as a whole, but it has made me think.</p>
<p>The author has many critiques of (other) productivity books. These
critiques are mostly wrong or exaggerated. One that I did find
meaningful was that often productivity is tied to the false belief
that things that aren't measured aren't valuable, as in
<a href="/20200425-tyranny_of_metrics_by_muller/">The Tyranny of Metrics</a>. This makes "productivity" sort of
self-centered, often; it isn't "productive" to volunteer, or engage in
civic life generally, to know local issues, to vote. This kind of
measurement-obsessed productivity, usually implicitly career-oriented,
becomes a misdirection of energy.</p>
<p>Burkeman accuses productivity advice of being unsustainable, but comes
down too far in the other direction, as if noting that it isn't
possible to sprint forever before concluding that all attempts to
cover distance are futile. This feels like the common tension between
accepting things exactly as they are as opposed to hating things as
they are and pushing to change them at all costs. As usual, neither
extreme is really great.</p>
<p>Burkeman wants you to live in the moment, which I tend to support as
well, but I don't agree with the reasoning having to come from
mortality. Fear of death can't really make you live in the moment;
death is in the future. Infinite life also wouldn't mean that choices
become meaningless; you would still have only one walk through the
garden of forking paths. Yes, value every moment—but not out of fear.
Not out of a scarcity mindset.</p>
<p><img alt="cover" src="cover.jpg"></p>
<hr>
<p>Burkeman references Seneca's <a href="/20240105-seneca_de_brevitate_vitae/">De Brevitate Vitae</a> on page four. I
think at some point he mentioned <a href="/20201107-how_to_live_on_24_hours_a_day/">How to Live on 24 Hours a Day</a> as
well.</p>
<hr>
<p>On page eight Burkeman mentions three productivity books:
<a href="/2011/03/14/listened-to-four-hour-work-week/">The Four-Hour Work Week</a>, <a href="/20220327-smarter_faster_better_by_duhigg/">Smarter, Faster, Better</a>, and Extreme
Productivity. I've read the first two, and after looking briefly into
the last, it looks like all of them in fact do talk a lot about
prioritizing and saying "no" to things. Burkeman's characterization of
the productivity literature as somehow ignoring this seems unfair.</p>
<hr>
<p>Burkeman says on page nine that productivity works but makes us feel
busier. This has not been my experience. I feel less stress when
things are managed, and I'm able to confidently know that I've taken
care of what I needed to.</p>
<p>Some large chunk of good time management is just memory aids, I think:
Ways of organizing things so that they don't fall through the cracks
and create stressful problems later.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>This struggle against the distressing constraints of reality is what
some old-school psychoanalysts call "neurosis," and it takes
countless forms, from workaholism and commitment-phobia to
codependency and chronic shyness.</p>
<p>Our troubled relationship with time arises largely from the same
effort to avoid the painful constraints of reality. (page 30)</p>

<p>This is an interesting characterization of neurosis, especially when
considered along with psychosis, in which neurosis is sort of fighting
against (or worrying about) reality, while psychosis is instead a
clear break with reality.</p>
<p>I'm not sure that's what people usually think of when they think
"neurosis," but it's kind of neat.</p>

putting my faith in the words of the author Richard Bach: "You teach
best what you most need to learn." (page 33)</p>

<p>This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Bach">Richard Bach</a> and his books including <em>Jonathan Livingston
Seagull</em> were apparently quite big in the 70s.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Think of it as “existential overwhelm”: the modern world provides an
inexhaustible supply of things that seem worth doing, and so there
arises an inevitable and unbridgeable gap between what you'd ideally
like to do and what you actually can do. (page 45)</p>

<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>The harder you struggle to fit everything in, the more of your time
you'll find yourself spending on the least meaningful things. Adopt
an ultra-ambitious time management system that promises to take care
of your entire to-do list, and you probably won't even get around to
the most important items on that list. Dedicate your retirement to
seeing as much of the world as you possibly can, and you probably
won't even get to see the most interesting parts. (page 48)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is ridiculous. Maybe this is where his whole argument falls
apart. It's just not true that you have to do everything, and I think
this passage illustrates the silliness of it. Who would literally aim
to see "as much of the world as you possibly can" and have that mean
devoting equal time to every square inch? For his claims here to make
any sense you have to imagine both having overwhelming and
indiscriminate FOMO and absolutely no sense of prioritization. Both
are problems to resolve, not axioms to reason from.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>The most fundamental thing we fail to appreciate about the world,
Heidegger asserts in his magnum opus, <em>Being and Time,</em> is how
bafflingly astonishing it is that it’s there at all – the fact that
there is anything rather than nothing. Most philosophers and
scientists spend their careers pondering the <em>way</em> things are: what
sorts of things exist, where they come from, how they relate to each
other, and so on. But we’ve forgotten to be amazed <em>that</em> things are
in the first place – that ‘a world is worlding all around us’, as
Heidegger puts it. This fact – the fact that <em>there is being,</em> to
begin with – is ‘the brute reality on which all of us ought to be
constantly stubbing our toes’, in the splendid phrase of the writer
Sarah Bakewell. But instead, it almost always passes us by. (page
58)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I sometimes think a related thing, paraphrasing Descartes, "I think,
therefore something is going on." I tend to identify with this
Heidegger snippet. Existence is a miracle.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>In his 2019 book, This Life, the Swedish philosopher Martin Hägglund
makes this all a bit clearer and less mystical by juxtaposing the
idea of facing our finitude with the religious belief in an eternal
life. If you really thought life would never end, he argues, then
nothing could ever genuinely matter, because you’d never be faced
with having to decide whether or not to use a portion of your
precious life on something. ‘If I believed that my life would last
forever,’ Hägglund writes, ‘I could never take my life to be at
stake, and I would never be seized by the need to do anything with
my time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This Hägglund may have some worthwhile things to say, but I think that
like Burkeman he's wrong to focus so much on death as the most
important thing, and wrong that without death nothing would matter.</p>
<p>I hear Hägglund is critical of capitalism, but I can't help but think
that the focus on finitude is a capitalist economic argument: if
supply (of time) is unlimited, then price (value) goes to zero. (I
don't believe this.)</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>It is by consciously confronting the certainty of death, and what
follows from the certainty of death, that we finally become truly
present for our lives. (page 63)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, no, no. This might be one path of reasoning that helps a person
become more present, but it isn't the only or necessary path.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>The real measure of any time management technique is <em>whether or not
it helps you neglect the right things.</em> (page 72)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>There's a section with these three principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay yourself first</li>
<li>Limit your work in progress<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.personalkanban.com/">Personal Kanban</a> suggests
    limiting to three things.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Resist the allure of middling priorities</li>

<p>This all seems like basically good advice.</p>
<hr>
<p>So this Bergson guy wrote <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_and_Free_Will">Time and free will</a> (mentioned on page
83) and, I mean, cool title, but otherwise doesn't seem that good,
especially if the thinking is similar in quality to Bergson's ideas
about motivated evolution.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Machine for misusing your life (page 94)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Burkeman mostly tries to avoid the appearance of value judgments by
framing the objective as spending time on what you value (whatever
that is) but he does come out clearly against social media. So you
better not value social media!</p>
<hr>
<p>There's an interesting sort of story about a monk's experience with
ice water, the point of which was that trying to ignore or deny the
experience of cold was worse than focusing on the experience and
accepting, living the experience.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>You're obliged to deal with how your experience is unfolding in this
moment, to resign yourself to the reality that <em>this is it.</em> (page
106)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He's trying to connect boredom to finitude in the sense of limited
lifespan, but he accidentally gives the lie to it. It isn't that
you're upset that you're using your limited time on Earth in a way
that isn't fun; it's that it isn't fun "in this moment."</p>
<p>He does talk about living in the moment, but doesn't seem to resolve
the conflict with the lifespan view.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>The real problem isn’t planning. It’s that we take our plans to be
something they aren’t. What we forget, or can’t bear to confront, is
that, in the words of the American meditation teacher Joseph
Goldstein, ‘a plan is just a thought’. We treat our plans as though
they are a lasso, thrown from the present around the future, in
order to bring it under our command. But all a plan is – all it
could ever possibly be – is a present-moment statement of intent.
It’s an expression of your current thoughts about how you’d ideally
like to deploy your modest influence over the future. The future, of
course, is under no obligation to comply. (page 123)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This makes sense. What's the quote I think of... Eisenhower: "Plans
are worthless, but planning is everything." The plan has no influence
over the future, but it does help you make decisions in the moments
you encounter.</p>
<hr>
<p>Burkeman mentions
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1456312030">Radically Condensed Instructions for Being Just as You Are</a>, which
is more nondualist, the-moment-is-all-there-is stuff.</p>
<p><em>Trying</em> to live in the moment is like trying too hard to sleep.
Trying to force it pushes you further from it. But on the other hand,
you have no other option but to be here now.</p>
<hr>
<p>Burkeman mentions Lafargue's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Right_to_Be_Lazy">The right to be lazy</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"According to Lafargue, wage labour is tantamount to slavery, and to
fight as a labour movement for the extension of slavery is
preposterous. In the book, Lafargue proposes the right to be lazy,
in contrast to the right to work, which he deems bourgeois."</p>

philosopher John Gray. He adds: ‘How can there be play in a time

<p>I think Burkeman also talks about instrumental use of time and tourist
photography, the "stop taking pictures and experience it" argument.</p>
<p>I think of my "<a href="/20181204-worth_doing_even_if_it_fails/">Is it worth doing even if it fails?</a>" which I think
is somewhat related... value the act itself regardless of the outcome.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The publisher and editor Karen Rinaldi feels about surfing the same
way that I do about cheesy piano rock, only more so: she dedicates
every spare moment she can to it, and even wiped out her savings on
a plot of land in Costa Rica for better access to the sea. Yet she
readily admits that she remains an appalling surfer to this day. (It
took her five years of attempting to catch a wave before she first
managed to do so.) But ‘in the process of trying to attain a few
moments of bliss’, Rinaldi explains, ‘I experience something else:
patience and humility, definitely, but also freedom. Freedom to
pursue the futile. And the freedom to suck without caring is
revelatory.’ Results aren’t everything. Indeed, they’d better not
be, because results always come later – and later is always too
late. (page 160)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Burkeman talks about a painting called "Boy with a Squirrel," but that
painting is "A Boy with a Flying Squirrel." <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Boy_with_a_Flying_Squirrel">Flying</a>!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It depicts Copley's teenaged half-brother Henry Pelham with a pet
flying squirrel, a creature commonly found in colonial American
portraits as a symbol of the sitter's refinement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How cool is that!</p>
<hr>
<p>There are "Three principles of patience" (around page 180)</p>
<ul>
<li>Develop a taste for having problems<ul>
<li>This reminds me of my first "thinking card,"
   <a href="https://planspace.org/20201206-thinking_cards/#1">embrace problems</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Embrace radical incrementalism </li>
<li>Originality lies on the far side of unoriginality</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Burkeman has this idea, "cosmic insignificance therapy," which is
intended to be a relief. It reminds me of the
<a href="https://hitchhikers.fandom.com/wiki/Total_Perspective_Vortex">total perspective vortex</a> from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the
Galaxy, but of course there it was supposed to be a method of torture.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a sort of cruelty, Iddo Landau points out, in holding
yourself to standards nobody could ever reach (and which many of us
would never dream of demanding of other people). The more humane
approach is to drop such efforts as completely as you can. Let your
impossible standards crash to the ground. Then pick a few meaningful
tasks from the rubble and get started on them today. (page 222)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Burkeman mentions this documentary, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13675784/">A Life’s Work</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What's it like to dedicate your life to work that won't be completed
in your lifetime? Fifteen years ago, filmmaker David Licata focused
on four projects and the people behind them in an effort to answer
this universal question.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To me this is about caring about something, whether it makes sense or
not, making meaning for yourself, and not really at all about death.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>You could think of this book as an extended argument for the
empowering potential of giving up hope. (page 231)</p>

<title>Make everything into Roth IRA</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>Retirement accounts are surprisingly flexible. Rules meant to keep
high earners from making certain contributions and to discourage
withdrawals before age 59½ can largely be worked around. Everything
can and often should get put into a Roth IRA.</p>
<p><img alt="table" src="table.png"></p>
<!--

-->

<p>All these accounts are about avoiding taxes, to encourage you to save
for retirement. “Traditional” accounts can be funded with “pre-tax
dollars,” and then you pay taxes when you move money out. Money you
put into “Roth” accounts has already been taxed, so when you take it
out it's “tax free.”</p>
<p>Traditional accounts can <em>also</em> be funded with after-tax dollars. If
your 401k plan allows it, you can contribute after-tax dollars beyond
the usual limit. This might seem pointless, except that you can then
<em>convert</em> those contributions to Roth. This allows you to put quite a
lot of money into a Roth 401k, and is sometimes called “mega backdoor
Roth 401k.” <em>(orange arrow in diagram)</em></p>
<p>People with <a href="https://www.schwab.com/ira/roth-ira/contribution-limits">high incomes</a> aren't allowed to contribute directly to
Roth IRAs (Individual Retirement Accounts) and (with slightly
different <a href="https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/ira-deduction-limits">limitations</a>) can't deduct contributions to a Traditional
IRA. But anyone can contribute after-tax dollars to a Traditional IRA
and then convert those contributions to Roth. This is sometimes called
“backdoor Roth IRA.” <em>(part of purple arrow in diagram)</em></p>
<p>After you've left an employer, you can convert your 401k accounts to
corresponding IRAs without tax implications. Mega backdoor Roth 401k
may be convertible to Roth IRA even while still employed. <em>(green
arrows in diagram)</em></p>
<p>You can also convert a Traditional 401k or Traditional IRA to a Roth
IRA. You pay tax on the converted amount. <em>(blue arrow, part of purple
arrow in diagram)</em> You can control the amounts of the conversions so
that you smooth your taxable income across years rather than having
large single conversion events that spike your annual income—and tax
rate.</p>
<p>Roth IRAs are particularly nice because they let you withdraw
contributions any time without penalty, which makes sense since they
were already taxed. In the case of roll-overs (conversions) you have
to wait five years before withdrawing penalty-free, but that can still
be years before age 59½, meaning money is not locked away to nearly
the same extent. Only investment gains are subject to penalty for
withdrawal before 59½. Additionally, Roth accounts are not subject to
Required Minimum Distributions starting around age 73 the way that
Traditional accounts are.</p>
<p>There are other exceptions to waiting until age 59½ (like if you leave
your job at 55 or older, or if you set up Substantially Equal Periodic
Payments under 72t) but you hardly need them.</p>
<h3>Example: $77k tax-advantaged in 2025</h3>
<p>The common employer-sponsored 401k has a $23,500 limit on total
pre-tax (“Traditional”) and Roth (after tax) employee contributions,
with a $70,000 total cap on employee and employer contributions.
Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) are limited to $7,000 in
contributions per year. (“Catch-up” adjustments increase these numbers
somewhat for people 50 and up.)</p>
<p>The choice of Traditional or Roth depends on your tax rate now
compared to when you expect to use the money, and there are
<a href="https://www.citizensbank.com/investing-and-wealth-management/products-services-and-calculators/financial-calculators/roth-401k-vs-traditional-401k-calculator.aspx">calculators</a> that can help you compare. If you are in a high tax
bracket currently, putting pre-tax money in a Traditional account can
help spread your income across years and lower the total effective tax
rate you pay.</p>
<p>Imagine a high-income individual under 50 who contributes $23,500
pre-tax to their 401k, reducing their tax for the current year. Say
they get 50% of that contribution matched by their employer ($11,750)
so the total pre-tax 401k contribution for the year is $35,250. After
they leave their employer, they can choose to convert that Traditional
401k to Roth IRA, paying tax when they make the conversion, and the
converted amount is withdrawable without penalty after five years.</p>
<p>Since the annual limit is $70,000, they can still contribute $34,750
more in after-tax dollars and convert that to Roth 401k. This can be
converted to Roth IRA at any point and the converted amount is
withdrawable without penalty after five years.</p>
<p>They can also contribute $7,000 (in after-tax dollars) toward a
Traditional IRA and then convert that to Roth, and the converted
amount is withdrawable without penalty after five years.</p>
<p>So in one year, this person has gotten $77,000 into tax-advantaged
retirement accounts, and the majority of it can be withdrawn without
penalty after just five years, regardless of their age.</p>
<hr>
<p>I am not a financial advisor, this is just my current understanding of
how these things work, please consult an expert before doing anything.
(And please tell me if I have anything wrong!)</p>

<title>Consider tax on investments</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>Taxes make everything more complicated. They vary based on your income
level, where you live, what investments you have, and what accounts
you have them in, and more. And they affect your real returns. Let's
compare income-generating investments.</p>
<form id="taxForm">

<h3>A nominally <input type="number" step="any" id="nominal_rate" value="5.00">% investment yields, after tax:</h3>

<ul>
  <li><b><span class="bignum" id="interest">3.50%</span></b> if it's regular interest from a bank, a CD, non-qualified dividends...
    <ul><li>Federal and state income tax apply.</li></ul>
  </li>
  <li><b><span class="bignum" id="dividend">3.75%</span></b> if it's <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/qualifieddividend.asp">qualified dividends</a>
    <ul><li>Federal long-term capital gains and state tax apply.</li></ul>
  </li>
  <li><b><span class="bignum" id="bond">4.00%</span></b> if it's interest from a US government bond
    <ul><li>Federal income tax applies, but not state tax.</li></ul>
  </li>
  <li><b><span class="bignum" id="muni">4.50%</span></b> if it's interest from a municipal bond
    <ul><li>Just state tax. (Or not; depends on your state and <a href="https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/not-always-tax-free-7-municipal-bond-tax-traps">other factors</a>.)</li></ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Most states don't differentiate between regular income and capital
gains, so there's just the one state tax box here. It probably makes
sense to use your overall effective (“blended”) tax rates here, though
you could use your marginal rates if you want. And of course this all
assumes we're in the US.</p>

<title>What is real? by Becker</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<blockquote>
<p>“The fact that an adequate philsophical presentation
[of quantum physics] has been so long delayed is no doubt caused by
the fact that Niels Bohr brainwashed a whole generation of
theorists,” Gell-Mann wrote in 1976. (page 253)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a former physics undergraduate student, I was excited to see if the
ugly Copenhagen interpretation had finally been retired. Becker gave
me some hope but in the end it looks like people are still mostly
shutting up and calculating. I still like the “what is real” framing,
even if the <a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/adam-becker/what-is-real/9781541698970/">book</a> can't completely deliver.</p>
<p>A few thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>One of the unique things about quantum physics is its ontic
   randomness. Even just skimming some of the book's references, like
   <a href="https://ia601501.us.archive.org/1/items/in.ernet.dli.2015.204850/2015.204850.Natural-Philosophy_text.pdf">Born</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190601184313/https://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~hrp/issues/1999/Hermann.pdf">Hermann</a>, it's clear people were wrestling with
   this a lot. But the author sort of puts it out of scope.</li>
<li>How, in a book on what is real, do you come so close as to discuss
   Quine's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Dogmas_of_Empiricism">Two Dogmas</a> but not dive into the myth of physical
   objects? (To be clear, there is discussion of scientific realism,
   but this aspect of it isn't much explored, as I recall.)</li>
<li>Similarly, there isn't much discussion of what we really think
   exists. Pointlike particles? (In what sense does anybody believe in
   them?) Discrete space? Something else? In what may be a bit of
   humor, the very last note at the end of the book is about how many
   interpretations don't, in fact, believe in "particles" as such at
   all.</li>
<li>I would have liked for there to be more on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map%E2%80%93territory_relation">map vs. territory</a> as
   it pertains to what is real. Where do we think the theory is "real"
   vs. where is it just a model? (There is some discussion of
   epistemic vs. ontic interpretations, though this could have been
   clearer too. I think this connects to
   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unreasonable_Effectiveness_of_Mathematics_in_the_Natural_Sciences">Unreasonable Effectiveness</a>, which also would have been
   interesting to see explored more.</li>
<li>Another connection that seems interesting is the mathematical idea
   of model theory, where you differentiate between a formal system
   and a model that satisfies it. With multiple interpretations that
   don't seem to have different predictions than "standard quantum
   physics" the interpretations start to feel like models in this

<li>It would have been nice to get more/clearer on Heisenberg's
   uncertainty principle. Looking into it more myself, I got as far as
   an interesting hint that you can understand it as position and
   momentum wave functions being mutually Fourier transforms, so if
   one is narrow the other is spread out.</li>
<li>In general, the author seemed sometimes to assume knowledge instead
   of clearly laying out enough to get up to speed. Part of this is
   probably just trying to avoid technicality that would put people
   off. To illustrate: DeWitt's <a href="https://cqi.inf.usi.ch/qic/deWitt1970.pdf">Quantum Mechanics and Reality</a> is
   great (and very approximately a short version of the whole book)
   but it has enough math notation in it that it probably puts off a
   lot of people who would otherwise read and enjoy it. (And it's
   trying to be gentle itself.) But if you don't explain spin or
   polarization (etc.) at all, people will also be left out. And when
   interpretation is largely about putting meaning to the math, it's
   hard to think about if you never see the math.</li>
<li>What kinds of things are eligible to constitute an interpretation?
   The math alone seems not to be. Do things have to reduce to
   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Na%C3%AFve_physics">naïve physics</a> in order to be part of an interpretation? Is any
   (non-mathematical) abstraction acceptable? Must it satisfy some
   assumptions? (Some might have put locality in that bucket,
   previously?)</li>
</ul>
<p>What is the Copenhagen interpretation?</p>
<ul>
<li>divide quantum vs. classical scales (vague)</li>
<li>wave function collapse on observation (measurement problem)</li>
<li>no hidden variables (it's not just that we don't know the state
   yet)</li>
<li>says nothing about the world (?)</li>
<li>wave-particle duality ("complementarity")</li>
</ul>
<p>Other interpretations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bohm pilot-wave</li>
<li>multiple worlds</li>
<li>superdeterminism</li>
<li>spontaneous collapse</li>

tearing down Copenhagen than in building any particular replacement;

quite an impression on Bell—especially the discussion of a proof by
the great mathematician and physicist John von Neumann. According to
Born, von Neumann had proven that the Copenhagen interpretation was
the only possible way of understanding quantum physics. So either
the Copenhagen interpretation was correct or quantum physics was
wrong. And, given the wild success of quantum physics, it seemed
that Copenhagen and its vagueness were here to stay. (pages 9-10)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, what does Born say?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It would be silly and arrogant to deny any possibility of a return
to determinism. For no physical theory is final; new experiences may
force us to alterations and even reversions. Yet scanning the
history of physics in the way we have done we see fluctuations and
vacillations, but hardly a reversion to more primitive conceptions.
I expect that our present theory will be profoundly modified. For it
is full of difficulties which I have not mentioned at all—the
self-energies of particles in interaction and many other quantities,
like collision cross-sections, lead to divergent integrals. But I
should never expect that these difficulties could be solved by a
return to classical concepts. I expect just the opposite, that we
shall have to sacrifice some current ideas and use still more
abstract methods. However, these are only opinions. A more concrete
contribution to this question has been made by J. v. Neumann in his
brillant book, <em>Mathematische Grundlagen der Quantenmechanik.</em> He
puts the theory on an axiomatic basis by deriving it from a few
postulates of a very plausible and general character, about the
properties of 'expectation values’ (averages) and their
representation by mathematical symbols. The result is that the
formalism of quantum mechanics is uniquely determined by these
axioms; in particular, no concealed parameters can be introduced
with the help of which the indeterministic description could be
transformed into a deterministic one. Hence if a future theory
should be deterministic, it cannot be a modification of the present
one but must be essentially different. How this should be possible
without sacrificing a whole treasure of well-established results I
leave to the determinists to worry about. (<em>Natural Philosophy of
Cause and Chance</em> pages 108-109)</p>

<p>This isn't about the Copenhagen interpretation, is it? This is about
hidden variables? (No-hidden-variables isn't what we mean by
Copenhagen, is it? I thought everybody agreed about no hidden
variables...)</p>
<p>This is fairly bad for the big structure of the book, which hinges on
the "proof of the Copenhagen interpretation" coming undone.</p>
<p>Coming back to this later: Maybe no-hidden-variables is/was part of
the Copenhagen interpretation? It seems like the author argues the
pilot-wave interpretation has hidden variables (but not locality) and
that shows von Neumann was wrong. But still, Born was talking about
determinism, and hidden variables also isn't the same thing as
determinism...</p>

dismissed such claims as unnecessary for the practice of science. To
Mach, one of the worst offenders was the great god of physics, Isaac
Newton himself. Newton's master-work, the <em>Principia,</em> opened with
the assumption that space and time were absolute entities unto
themselves, with real existence out in the world. This “conceptual
monstrosity of absolute space” was, in Mach's view, “purely a
thought-thing which cannot be pointed to in experience.” Mach
thought that a proper science of mechanics would dispense with these
kinds of ontological claims—claims about what things actually exist
in the real world—and instead simply lay down descriptive,
mathematical laws that accurately predict the observed motion of all
objects. Good theories, according to Mach, were about connecting
observations, not about positing things that couldn't be observed at
all. (page 25)</p>

<p>Heisenberg started thinking about what would happen if you tried to
measure the position of a single particle, like an electron, to very
high precision. He realized that you could do this the same way
you'd look for a lost wallet in a dark field: shine a flashlight
around until you've found what you're looking for. An ordinary
flashlight wouldn't work for an electron, though—the wavelength of
visible light is far too large for that. But Heisenberg knew you
could find an electron using higher-energy light, with a shorter
wavelength: gamma rays. Shine a gamma-ray flashlight around a room,
and you'll find your electron. But gamma rays pack a punch—bounce
one gamma-ray photon off an electron, and the electron will go
careening off in some random direction. So you'll know where the
electron was, but you won't know how fast it's going or where it's
heading now. (page 38)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a standard bad take. Even if there's some historicity to it,
in how Heisenberg was thinking, it's misleading to make uncertainty
seem like it's about physicality of measurement.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Bohr pointed to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle as further
justification for the inevitability of complementarity. Using
Heisenberg's gamma-ray flashlight as an example, he pointed out that
there was no way to precisely measure the momentum of an electron
when observing its position, and vice versa. Bohr then echoed Mach,
as Heisenberg had, and claimed the impossibility of measuring both
properties simultaneously. Position and momentum, like particles and
waves, were complementary—never used at once but both needed for the
complete description of a situation.</p>
<p>But Bohr was wrong. There was nothing inevitable or necessary about
complementarity—other interpretations of quantum physics are
possible. Indeed, the claim of inevitability is an awfully strong
and strange claim to make about any interpretive issue in science,
precisely because it is always possible to reinterpret any theory.
Yet Bohr was convinced that complementarity was the deepest insight
into nature found within the quantum theory.</p>
<p>Stranger still is Bohr's use of the gamma-ray flashlight to bolster
his claims. It's certainly true that the thought experiment
illustrates a world in which there are limits on our knowledge, but
it's also a world where particles have well-defined positions and
momenta at all times. Hitting an electron with a gamma ray can't
alter the electron's momentum unless it has a momentum in the first
place. We don't know what that momentum is—but that's certainly not
the same thing as saying it doesn't exist. (page 40)</p>

it—particles are just particles, and their motions are guided by
pilot waves. Particles surf along these waves, guided by the waves'
motion (hence the name). Heisenberg's uncertainty principle still
holds—the more we know about a particle's position, the less we know
about its momentum, and vice versa—but according to Bohm, this is
simply a limitation on the information that the quantum world is

<p>Quine spends more time on the analytic-synthetic distinction than on

<p>On the analytic-synthetic distinction, I think Quine is pointing out
problems with human language, not proving the non-distinction he aims
to prove. Certainly mathematical tautologies are analytic.</p>
<p>It is indeed hard to talk about the world though (synthetic). From the wiki:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to Quine, there are two different results of his
reasoning. The first is a blurring of the line between metaphysics
and natural science. The common-sense theory about physical objects
is epistemologically comparable to the gods of Homer. Quine is a
physicalist, in the sense that he considers it a scientific error
not to adopt a theory which makes reference to physical objects.
However, like Gods of Homer, physical objects are posits, and there
is no great epistemic difference in kind; the difference is rather
that the theory of physical objects has turned out to be a more
efficient theory. After having defined himself an "empiricist",
Quine states in Two Dogmas: "The myth of physical objects is
epistemologically superior to most in that it has proved more
efficacious than other myths as a device for working a manageable
structure into the flux of experience".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I like this "myth of physical objects;" maybe that's a helpful phrase
for thinking about things. As in the discussion of books and electrons
above: which myths do you think are useful? Which do you really
believe? Is it helpful to "really believe" in those things in Plato's
realm of ideals?</p>

began to form among professional philosophers of science, a position
in opposition to logical positivism, which they called <em>scientific

<p>What do I think? I think it's asking too much to believe in

<p>First, "bears no relation at all to the actual stuff in the world" is
not the same as "is the same as the actual stuff in the world."
Electrons can be a useful thing to act as if is real, regardless of
whether electrons "exist" in a physical sense or we're in a simulation

<p>The theories themselves suggest explanations for the phenomena that
we see based on the unobserved stuff. But if the unobserved stuff is
just a convenient picture that just happens to come along with the
“real” content of the theory (i.e., the predictions about the
observable world) and that picture really doesn't line up with the
stuff in the world in any way, then we're astonishingly lucky that
our theories work so well! (page 185)</p>

<p>And a celebrated series of articles on Bell's theorem by the
distinguished Cornell physicist N. David Mermin elucidated the
subject for his fellow physicists through a set of particularly
simple thought experiments, which rapidly became the standard way of
teaching the subject. (page 224)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe one of them is this "<a href="https://www.ringnebula.com/CosIG/28e-Mermin-Quantum-mysteries-for-anyone-1981.pdf">Quantum mysteries for anyone</a>" which
features the example that our author presents as variations on
roulette wheels. (Credit is given, in a note on page 333.) It's nice that at the end Mermin explains a real
possible realization of the apparatus.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One method, [of quantum cryptography] developed by Charles Bennett
and Gilles Brassard in 1984, was based on a result known as the
“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-cloning_theorem">no-cloning theorem</a>,” which had been proven in response done by the
Fundamental Fysiks Group. (page 226)</p>
<p>In physics, the no-cloning theorem states that it is impossible to
create an independent and identical copy of an arbitrary unknown
quantum state, a statement which has profound implications in the
field of quantum computing among others.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I expect that the Copenhagen interpretation will some time be
called the greatest sophism in the history of science,” he [Zeh]
wrote to Wheeler in 1980, “but I would consider it a terrible
injustice if—when some day a solution should be found—some people
claim that ‘this is of course what Bohr always meant,’ only because
he was sufficiently vague.” (pages 232-233)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>(Wheeler himself misunderstood the Bell experiments as ruling out
determinism, rather than locality.) (page 234)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reference is Wheeler and Zurek's 1983 <em>Quantum Theory and
Measurement,</em> page 188.</p>
<p>Wheeler says, in his chapter called "Law without Law":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not the slightest hard evidence has ever been found that would throw
doubt on the plain, straightforward prediction of quantum mechanics,
the prediction that no prediction is possible. Probability? Yes. A
definite forecast? No. Einstein could be unhappy that “God plays
dice”; but Bohr could tell him jokingly, “Einstein, stop telling God
what to do.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It isn't super clear to me that this ties directly to Bell
experiments, but I didn't look at the Wheeler book for long. And
didn't everybody agree that (non-probabilistic) determinism was out
anyway? Doesn't seem like you need Bell for that.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Why do we even need a different [from Copenhagen] interpretation,
much less a different theory altogether
[given quantum theory works so well]?</p>
<p>Bell framed his reply as a moral issue. “It is not right to tell the
public that a central role for conscious mind is integrated into
modern atomic physics. Or that ‘information’ is the real stuff of
physical theory. It seems to me irresponsible to suggest that
technical features of contemporary theory were anticipated by the
saints of ancient religions ... by introspection.” Bell felt an
urgent need to solve the problems at the core of quantum physics—but
he had little patience for purported solutions that were little more
than vague declarations of faith. He wanted something more definite,
something that wasn't a professional embarrassment, a true theory
that didn't shy away from questions about what happened during
measurement. His relentlessly clear writing gave no quarter to
anyone hoping to take solace in the comforting platitudes of the
Copenhagen interpretation. “Surely, after 62 years, we should have
an exact formulation of some part of quantum mechanics?” Bell said
in 1989. “[Measurement devices] should not be separated off from the
rest of the world into black boxes, as if [they] were not made of
atoms and not ruled by quantum mechanics.” In a talk he gave in
Geneva in January 1990, Bell acknowledged that the task at hand was
difficult and that his own theorem proved that there was some
radical change necessary, something that physics would have to come
to terms with. “I think you're stuck with the nonlocality,” Bell
told the small group who came to hear him speak that day. “I don't
know any conception of locality which works with quantum mechanics.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On information specifically, I'm reminded of my old buddy <a href="/2012/05/18/quotes-from-frederick-w-kantor/">Kantor</a>,
whose work I've still never really understood.</p>
<p>But overall yes, I agree with Bell here.</p>
<hr>
<p>Looks like "the Jura" are another mountain range, like "the Alps" also
are. (page 239)</p>

<p>"Pellucid" is used on page 240. It means "translucently clear."</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>DeWitt's article, “<a href="https://cqi.inf.usi.ch/qic/deWitt1970.pdf">Quantum Mechanics and Reality</a>,” did review
several interpretations. (page 243)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's read that article.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some writers have also insisted that the process described by
equation 4 merely prepares the system and that the measurement is
not complete until a more complicated piece of apparatus observes
the outcome of the preparation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is very funny, as the "more complicated piece of apparatus" is a
person: he's alluding to consciousness, but obliquely. (He gets to it
shortly.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quantum mechanics is a theory that attempts to describe in
mathematical language a world in which chance is not a measure of
our ignorance but is absolute.</p>
<p>This universe is constantly splitting into a stupendous number of
branches, all resulting from the measurementlike interactions
between its myriads of components.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Measurementlike" is key, and possibly confusing. Maybe "decoherent"
would be better?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, in the very early moments of the universe, during the
cosmological "Big Bang," the universal wave function may have
possessed an overall coherence as yet unimpaired by condensation
into noninterfering branches.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was the bit that made me start to think I understood better what
decoherence means, and why the splitting of many worlds doesn't
necessarily have the observer problem any more.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Finally, the EWG ["many worlds"] interpretation of quantum mechanics
has an important contribution to make to the philosophy of science.
By showing that formalism alone is sufficient to generate
interpretation, it has breathed new life into the old idea of a
direct correspondence between formalism and reality. The reality
implied here is admittedly bizarre. To anyone who is awestruck by
the vastness of the presently known universe, the view from where
Everett, Wheeler and Graham sit is truly impressive. Yet it is a
completely causal view, which even Einstein might have accepted. At
any rate, it has a better claim than most to be the natural end
product of the interpretation program begun by Heisenberg in 1925.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I like some of <a href="/20220410-beginning_of_infinity_by_deutsch/">Deutsch's stuff</a>, but I hadn't been on board re: many
worlds, before. Maybe I'm getting convinced?</p>
<p>Something interesting happens then, doesn't it? Quantum mechanics is
indeed ontologically random, at the lowest level, and the wave
function captures that. But as we look backward in time, it's
epistemic from the point of view of the evolution of our specific
world vantage point. Before we start a Schrödinger's cat experiment,
we predict 50/50 odds and that's really true, there's an irreducible
randomness. After running the experiment, however, the wave function
describes our state of knowledge but not the reality. The cat really
is alive or dead and not both, in the world path that we're really in.</p>
<p>And that's how it always is, isn't it? Predictions forward, knowledge
backward...</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>General relativity didn't merely deal with abstruse situations—it
was also written in abstruse mathematics. The theory is very
mathematically complex, far more so than quantum mechanics. (page
246)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>But it's not clear that Everett himself truly believed that the many
worlds implied by his interpretation were literally real, as DeWitt
did. (page 251)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not sure it's even clear what "literally real" means here... It
seems clear they're not like islands in the sea, independent entities
that you can skip between. More like aspects of the wave function than
like separate wave functions, right?</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>When Don Reisler, a physicist with a PhD in quantum foundations,
applied to work at Everett's company, Everett shyly asked if he was
a ware of the relative-state interpretation. Reisler immediately
thought, “Oh my God, you are <em>that</em> Everett, the crazy one.” (page
251)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Everett's many-worlds interpretation was also called "relative-state.")</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>As Quine said, our beliefs about the world can only be tested
against the world as a group, not individually, and this holds for
falsification just as much as for verification. No theory, in
isolation, is falsifiable. (page 262)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(part of a takedown re: Popper)</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Ultimately, arguments against a multiverse purportedly based on
falsifiability are really arguments based on ignorance and taste:
some physicists are unaware of the history and philosophy of their
own field and find multiverse theories unpalatable. But that does
not mean that multiverse theories are unscientific. (pages 263-264)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yikes! Who hurt you?</p>
<p>(It's right about here that the writing gets dramatically spicier.)</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Zeilinger has suggested that the “message of the quantum” is the
fairly positivist idea that “the distinction between reality and our
knowledge of reality, between reality and information, cannot be
made.” (page 271)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Just a few generations ago, at the birth of quantum physics, all
physicists received some schooling in philosophy. Einstein read
Mach, Bohr read Kant. But the shifts in research funding and physics
classrooms after World War II also led to broader shifts in
university curricula. For Einstein and Bohr's generation, philosophy
was part of the core educational curriculum in central Europe. But
in postwar America, it was (and is) relatively easy for an
intelligent student to go all the way from kindergarten to a PhD in
physics at a top-tier university without ever darkening the door of
a philosophy classroom. (page 273)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(part of a section decrying lack of love for philosophy)</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>But with the massive increase in knowledge and information in the
last century, education became unavoidably specialized. (page 273)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unavoidably? I think this is an exaggerated claim. I think maybe we've
done a poor job in organizing and explaining the knowledge we (should)
have. Not to mention all the people who seem to get a lot of education
and still come out knowing basically nothing.</p>
<p>A contributing factor might be the allegedly unopinionated kitchen
sink nature of curricula, where the view is wide and often historical
even when the knowledge isn't fundamentally historical in nature.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>“All of the proposals we have for solving the measurement problem
are weird in one way or another,” said David Albert. “Bell's theorem
proves they have to be weird. ... [But] there's a huge difference
between being weird and being incoherent or unintelligible.” And,
Albert added, many physicists still do not seem to appreciate this
point. “Physicists will say, ‘Yes, the Copenhagen interpretation is
weird, but so is everything else.’ And you sort of want to slap them
and say, ‘No! The Copenhagen interpretation is not <em>weird,</em> it's
gibberish, it's unintelligible.’” (page 283)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree with this; it seems generous to even call Copenhagen an
interpretation.</p>
<p>Oh! And in this note (page 340) there's a quote from Bas van Fraassen:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“by today's standards [Copenhagen] is not an interpretation.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Science and culture form an undivided whole, now more than ever, in
our world whose every corner has been reshaped by human activity.

<p>The appendix, <em>Four Views of the Strangest Experiment,</em> is good.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>... Copenhagen delenda est.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Copenhagen must be destroyed, following the shortened form of Cato's
repeated call for the destruction of Carthage.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>In most versions of many-worlds, there are no particles as such; the
same is true for most versions of spontaneous-collapse theories. So
my use of the word “photon” is a bit of a fudge, but you can just
read it as “wave packet” if you're really persnickety. (page 342)</p>

<title>(Audio) I Hate the Ivy League, by Gladwell</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>This is the first time I've seen a collection of podcasts packaged as
an <a href="https://www.pushkin.fm/audiobooks/i-hate-the-ivy-league-riffs-and-rants-on-elite-education">audiobook</a>. There is no corresponding printed book that you can
buy. Sort of weird, but Gladwell is good enough that it works.</p>
<hr>
<p>I tend to agree with Gladwell. Education shouldn't be an elitist thing
based on keeping people out.</p>
<hr>
<p>One thing Gladwell discusses is two opposing views of what education
should do, corresponding to two opposing views of what we need.</p>
<p>He uses basketball and soccer to illustrate the two views, saying that
in basketball you win based on your <em>best</em> players, while in soccer
you win based on your <em>worst</em> players. So in basketball it's okay to
have some weaker players, if your star/s is/are great, while in soccer
you might win more by improving your worst players.</p>
<p>I've heard this explicitly, for education. Kai-fu Lee <a href="/20200926-ai_superpowers_by_lee/" title="AI Superpowers, by Lee">says</a> that
good educational "programs seek to identify and realize the potential
of the country's top technical minds, an approach suited to creating
the material prosperity that can then be broadly shared across
society."</p>
<p>From another angle, it's the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_man_theory">great man theory</a> against the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ortega_hypothesis">Ortega hypothesis</a>, roughly.</p>
<p>From another angle, it's conservatism vs. progressivism: individuals
should be able to succeed wildly, vs. the poorest should be helped.</p>
<p>Gladwell also relates this idea to the Industrial Revolution happening
in England. He attributes it to the abundance of tinkerers/inventors
all working on things. (Cf. <a href="/20250322-power_and_progress_by_acemoglu_and_johnson/">Power and Progress</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p>Gladwell doesn't like timed tests. I'm a little torn, but I do have to
wonder: Did timed standardized tests influence my work style? Would I
have been better off with more focus on longer-term planning and
projects?</p>
<hr>
<p>“Mirror-tocracy”</p>
<hr>
<p>There's an interesting bit about how <a href="https://mcconville.rbind.io/">Kelly McConville</a>'s students
reverse-engineered the US News college rankings. It's a place where
regression makes sense, because the methodology of the rankings
matches up with what regression can do. It also reminded me of my old
project on <a href="/20190529-understanding_myintuition/">Understanding MyinTuition</a>.</p>
