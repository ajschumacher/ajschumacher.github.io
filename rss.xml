<title>Black Holes, by Cox and Forshaw</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>When I was in elementary school, I found a book about black holes in
the school library. It was wonderful, and it covered approximately the
first chapter of this year's very British <a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/black-holes-brian-coxjeff-forshaw">book</a> from Cox and
Forshaw. I don't recall <a href="https://guide.wisc.edu/courses/physics/">Physics 247</a> (2001) having much more than
that either. It's good to see that science has continued!</p>
<p>Hearing about black holes feels like exploring weird edge case
trade-offs in the design of the universe. Quantum mechanics gets
involved, multiplying the disregard for everyday experience. The
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime#Spacetime_interval">spacetime interval</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_diagram">Penrose diagrams</a> increase clarity, and
the Principle of Maximal Ageing is nice. But then we also get
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole_complementarity">Black hole complementarity</a> (you both fall across the event horizon
<em>and</em> get burned up at the event horizon) and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic_principle">the holographic principle</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ER_%3D_EPR">ER = EPR</a>. Wild! Keep it up,
science!</p>
<p>The subtitle is "The key to understanding the universe." It's a
compelling hook, and extremes do highlight interesting questions, but
the authors eventually admit that explaining natural phenomena is also
meaningfully distinct from some kinds of understanding, and they
"leave questions of ultimate truth to others" (page 237).</p>

<p>A singularity, a moment rather than a place when our knowledge of
the laws of Nature breaks down. According to general relativity, the
singularity lies at the end of time. There is also a singularity in
our past, which marks the beginning of time: the Big Bang. (page 2)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Georges Lemaître, a Catholic priest and one of the founders of
modern cosmology, described the Big Bang singularity at the origin
of our Universe as a day without a yesterday. A singularity formed
by gravitational collapse is a moment with no tomorrow. (page 5)</p>

<p>Sir Roger Penrose’s Nobel Prize-winning <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevLett.14.57">paper</a> ‘Gravitational
Collapse and Space-Time Singularities’, a three-page tour-de-force
in which Penrose proves that, in Wheeler’s words, ‘for just about
any description of matter that anyone has imagined, a singularity
must sit at the centre of a black hole’. (page 16)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>in science, unlike modern-day politics, principles matter. (page 18)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thought this was funny, but also true?</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Space and time may be emergent entities that do not exist in the
deepest description of Nature. Instead, they are synthesised out of
entangled quantum bits of information in a way that resembles a
cleverly constructed computer code. If the Universe is designed, it
seems, the designer is a programmer. (page 20)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I feel like they never really came back to this and really pay it off
completely, later in the book...</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>The Large Hadron Collider at CERN is the world’s most powerful
particle accelerator. The giant machine’s job is to make protons
travel around its underground tunnel at 99.999999 per cent the speed
of light, before smashing them together. The purpose is to explore
the structure of matter and the forces of Nature that animate our
world. The LHC is 27 kilometres in circumference from the point of
view of someone standing on the ground in Geneva, marvelling at this
great engineering achievement. From the point of view of the protons
orbiting around the ring, the circumference is 4 metres. (page 25)</p>

<p>That night down the pub. (page 30)</p>

<p>Is this British grammar? Can I be "down the" other things? "That day
down the library"?</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>An entirely reasonable first response to that last paragraph is to
ask what on earth are we talking about. (page 41)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes indeed.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>The point is that, in relativity theory, it is very important to say
exactly how time differences are being determined. Seeing things
(with instruments like eyes) can be very different from measuring
the passage of time using a network of clocks and rulers. The effect
we just discussed is known as the relativistic Doppler effect and it
is sensitive to the location of the light detector (i.e. where the
eyes are). (page 61)</p>

<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>From the perspective of someone in freefall across the shell at the
Schwarzschild radius the Equivalence Principle informs us that
nothing untoward happens. (page 89)</p>

<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>for a typical stellar mass black hole you’d be spaghettified before
you even reached the horizon. (page 103)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But not a really big black hole! Then you get spaghettified well after
crossing the horizon.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>In particular, the idea that microscopic wormholes could be part of
the structure of spacetime is part of the ER = EPR hypothesis we’ll
meet in the final chapters. (page 130)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Both the maximally extended Schwarzschild and Kerr solutions are
vacuum solutions to Einstein’s equations–eternal black holes–and as
far as we know, no such black holes exist. (page 141)</p>

<p>Nature is not obliged to make physicists’ lives easier. (page 144)</p>

<hr>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Noether" title="Emmy Noether">Noether</a> discovered that the law of conservation of energy is a
direct consequence of time translational invariance, which when the
jargon is stripped away means that the result of an experiment does
not depend on what day of the week it is performed (all other things
being equal). Likewise, the law of momentum conservation is a
consequence of translational invariance in space, which means the
result does not depend on where the experiment is performed (all
other things being equal). (page 146)</p>

<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>David L. Goodstein begins his textbook States of Matter with the
following paragraph: ‘Ludwig Boltzmann, who spent much of his life
studying statistical mechanics, died in 1906, by his own hand. Paul
Ehrenfest, carrying on the work, died similarly in 1933. Now it is
our turn to study Statistical Mechanics.’ (page 172)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now here is writing that takes bold risks!</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>The remainder of the book is about the quest to understand the deep
origins of black hole thermodynamics; a quest that is edging us ever
closer to a new theory of space and time. (page 187)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Hawking’s discovery that black holes emit particles is of profound
importance, not least because it suggests that the origin of the law
of gravity is statistical. (page 190)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is now understood that vacuum fluctuations cause the electrons
[in fluorescent lights] to fall back down to the lower energy levels
inside the atom. They ‘tickle’ the atom and trigger the emission of

</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>There is one logical possibility that could explain the results
without resorting to quantum theory: every event in the Universe is
predetermined, freewill does not exist and the results were baked in
at the beginning of time. Putting that aside, we are left with
quantum mechanics. (page 215)</p>

possible to operate on some small region of the vacuum in such a way
that anything can be created anywhere in the Universe. This
phenomenal conjuring trick is theoretically possible because the
vacuum is inexorably entangled. The outlandish nature of the theorem
is diminished ever-so-slightly by the fact that the local operation
required is not something that we could ever perform, which is a
shame. (page 218)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>From the perspective of someone freely falling through the horizon,
they feel nothing and are oblivious to this magical encoding.
Moreover, their fate is to be both spaghettified in the singularity
(from their own perspective) and burnt up on the horizon (from an
outsider’s perspective). But that is no problem for the laws of
Nature because no observer can be present at both events. This is
the essence of the black hole complementarity resolution to the
black hole information paradox. Is it nonsense? (page 226)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>The inside of a black hole, in other words, is somehow ‘the same’ as
the outside. This idea has become known as the holographic
principle. (page 227)</p>

<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Gravity thus emerges as a result of the quantum mechanics of a
system on the boundary. (page 237)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>We might ask which of these two descriptions is the real one. Is
there really a black hole or is it just a hologram of the boundary
physics? Or maybe the opposite is true, and the boundary physics is
not real and is just a clever way to describe the black hole. Maybe
trying to figure out what is ‘really’ true is to fall into a trap
that has long plagued physicists because it leads to navel gazing
without revealing deeper insight. There are plenty of people in the
world who can perform that function, and too few physicists, so
perhaps we should restrict ourselves to explaining natural phenomena
and leave questions of ultimate truth to others. Rather, the
holographic principle can be viewed as a realisation of
complementarity. There are two equivalent descriptions of the world,
and because they are equivalent there will be no contradictions:
What is true in one will be true in the other. This is the power of
the holographic principle, and Maldacena discovered a precise,
mathematical realisation of it. (page 237)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>The wormhole appears when we allow the two quantum theories to
become entangled. In other words, entanglement builds the wormhole
connecting the two universes together: quantum entanglement and
wormholes go hand in hand. This is a profoundly important connection
between quantum theory and gravity. (page 240)</p>

<title>Conversion of Guelph energy to mass (p=0.049)</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p><em>This is a short story I wrote in the second half of 2022. The image is from <a href="https://dezgo.com/">Dezgo</a>.</em></p>
<p><img alt="a tiny old wooden waterwheel moves gently with the water in a slow creak passing through a verdant forest" src="image.png"></p>
<p>“Are you sure you really want to know?” Verona asked, looking up from
her book. The wind off the ocean had slowed but the beach was still
cooling as evening approached. The sky was all pinks and purples now.
It was a pleasant, easy day.</p>
<p>“Maybe it doesn't even mean anything…” Adam finished pulling his
fingers through the sand one last time before turning with a smile.
“Are you hungry?”</p>
<p>They had both recently detected a faint smell of grilling nearby. Soon
they would go to dinner at one of the resort's restaurants, before
retiring to their room. This required very little coordination. They
enjoyed being in sync.</p>
<p>Verona grinned as she got up and began to shake out her towel. “Are
you going to say it doesn't mean anything in your dissertation?” Adam
was picking up the vanilla sun lotion and a few empty bottles.</p>
<p>“If I come out and say it, will there be any subtext left?” They were
both happy. “Besides, I need space for all the null results and
extended caveats.”</p>
<hr>
<p>It had been a surprise when brain-scan research led to a breakthrough
in understanding dark matter.</p>
<p>A new type of live brain scanner was designed with a calibration point
that was expected to read zero. This zero-point check worked fine for
some people. But for others, there was something there, where there
should have been nothing. The research team at the University of
Guelph initially called it strangely-interacting energy.</p>
<p>Particle physicists took an interest in this new zero-point
measurement and before long showed, to everyone's surprise, that it
was detecting one end of a spectrum that was somehow perpendicular to
everything that had been measured before. At one end was the
strangely-interacting energy. At the other end was
strangely-interacting mass: dark matter. The whole phenomenon came to
be called Guelph field.</p>
<p>The way Guelph energy interacts with regular matter is like a
paddle-wheel in water, if it's always impossible to tell whether the
water is pushing the wheel or the wheel is pushing the water. It
doesn't matter whether you see just one or the other or both; the
motion is the same.</p>
<p>The apparatus that makes it possible to observe Guelph energy is
called a McKinsey device. Zero-point measurement was sufficiently
paradigm-shifting that physicists sometimes almost forget that
McKinsey brain scanners are state of the art for their intended task
as well. As for Guelph mass, it is only observable by its gravity.</p>
<p>McKinsey scanners are expensive, but they're a good deal cheaper than
particle accelerators.</p>
<hr>
<p>“When I was a kid, she would take me canoeing sometimes, just for
fun.” Adam stood near the yellow wall of the funeral home while
unfamiliar extended family milled about slowly.</p>
<p>Verona had met Adam's great-grandmother only a handful of times in the
last few years. “Will she be speaking?”</p>
<p>A tiny smile flickered across Adam's face. “She was old-fashioned. She
said her family was better than any copy of her would be.” Adam
sighed.</p>
<p>“Do you think she was Guelph positive?” Verona was trying to bring
Adam to a friendly and familiar topic. She was surprised when he
looked away into the distance for a while before replying.</p>
<p>“Sorry; I feel like I don't have a lot of room to think right now.”
Adam paused again.</p>
<p>Verona answered for him. “I bet she was. I know everybody always says
so. She was so special to you all. She must have been, right? Just
like I feel like I must be, and you must be.” Verona squeezed Adam's
hand.</p>
<p>“I don't know. I didn't expect to feel like this.” Adam continued to
search for what to say. “I'm almost glad there isn't a copy; I think
it would be harder with one here.”</p>
<hr>
<p>At first, Guelph energy wasn't found anywhere outside biological human
brains. It has never been observed in dog brains, or dolphin brains,
or cuttlefish brains. It has never been observed in fruit trees, or
vacuum, or radioactive materials.</p>
<p>It would be a perfect answer to the question of what makes humans
different from all other creatures, except that not all humans are
Guelph positive. Measurements are, however, consistently binary:
either it's there or it isn't.</p>
<p>Guelph energy is detected in about half of people. When it is
detected, the signal is strongest in the cerebral cortex and fades
quickly at the brain stem. Repeated zero-point measurements are
consistent across the life span, until death.</p>
<p>Guelph energy has never been observed in a dead brain. There are two
main theories for why this is. The dissipation theory holds that the
energy is no longer attached to the brain and radiates outward to
unobservable levels. The conversion theory holds that the Guelph
energy changes state, becoming undetectable amounts of dark matter.</p>
<p>It isn't clear why Guelph energy should have an affinity for human
brains in the first place, or why this should change at death. No
experiment has been devised to resolve the debate between the
dissipation and conversion theories, or any of the many less plausible
alternative theories.</p>
<hr>
<p>“I think the least realistic part was just that so many labs would let
him use their gear.” Adam and Verona didn't always like the same
content, but they had found a movie called “Check Again” in which a
man becomes obsessed with getting McKinsey zero-point tests, until he
finds love in Greenland.</p>
<p>“It's more fun if you suspend your disbelief, you know,” Verona
replied. It was a familiar conversation. “Or, if you want to nitpick,
just think of the expense!”</p>
<p>“You're okay with the core concept?” asked Adam, relaxing back into
the couch expansively.</p>
<p>“People have all sorts of beliefs about Guelph. It's easy to forget
how many people really take it so seriously. But that's not what the
movie was about! It didn't matter what the tests said; it's the same
old story of a lonely guy who thinks proving himself will fill that
empty space.”</p>
<p>Adam leaned over with a smile to kiss her.</p>
<hr>
<p>In a Turing identity test, an examiner converses with two entities,
one human and one computer. As in a traditional Turing test, the
examiner seeks to determine which is human. The additional wrinkle is
that the human and computer are both claiming to be the same person.
The examiner must make a choice, so if the human and computer are
exactly equivalent, the examiners will be right in about half of
tests.</p>
<p>There are many types of brain scanners. They vary in fidelity, but
they all produce digital versions of a mind. Most techniques in
current use make copies that reliably pass Turing identity tests with
loved ones. All have no effect on Guelph field, except for McKinsey
scanners.</p>
<p>For years it was only known that if an individual who had tested
Guelph positive was subsequently copied using a McKinsey scanner, that
person's brain would afterward test negative.</p>
<p>A particularly well-funded professor decided to have her lab
demonstrate that a computer running a copy was as Guelph-free as every
other non-brain thing. The demonstration did not go as expected, and
turned instead into a series of revolutionary papers.</p>
<p>Work on explaining the mobility of Guelph energy led to
reconsideration of Kantor's development of information mechanics. That
field had moved for a while fruitlessly in the direction of digital
physics, but was revitalized by the problem of brains, computers, and
Guelph field.</p>
<p>The stability of computer-linked Guelph energy is not well
characterized but seems to depend on particulars of operating system
and low-level hardware implementations. In particular, copying a copy
has never led to observing two distinct Guelph loci. This has led some
to speculate that there should be a “McKinsey computer,” but no
concrete proposal for what this would mean in practice has yet
surfaced.</p>
<hr>
<p>“Will I ever get to meet Professor Loi?” Verona joined Adam at a small
white table in the community cafeteria that they liked. They sat with
steaming bowls of phở between them.</p>
<p>“It's getting harder for me to get even my usual scheduled time with
him. He's been insisting on talking to himself more recently, spawning
more copies and then keeping them all around, for analysis, he says.”</p>
<p>“I thought you said he was already way over budget?”</p>
<p>“He is, but he won't work with any of his PhD students unless he gets
to work on his own research. All the copies talk to each other; he's
like a union unto himself and none of the universities he's at can
afford to lose him.”</p>
<p>“Weird! Do you know what he's working on?”</p>
<p>“I can barely get him to explain what I'm working on. But hey,” Adam
raised his water glass, “this morning he said the hardware simulation
tests look good and we should be able to start recruiting subjects
soon.”</p>
<hr>
<p>Guelph field has an obvious connection to gravity, via dark matter,
but as with general relativity, the relationship between Guelph field
and quantum mechanics is unresolved. The “zero-point” of Guelph
detection is not related to zero-point quantum energy. This hasn't
stopped all manner of popular misconceptions from flourishing, despite
typically having as much grounding as saying Guelph field is elf
energy because of the rhyme.</p>
<p>Among the most persistent misinformation is that there is no Guelph
energy. The allegedly quantum basis for this claim hinges on the
mistaken belief that readings from McKinsey devices are quantum
observer effects based on nothing more than stochastic noise. These
theories generally try to explain the persistent patterns observed
with some appeal to entanglement over time or even more incoherent
ideas about beliefs influencing observations.</p>
<p>Contributing to distrust of Guelph theory is the subject-observer
isolation that is an intrinsic part of all McKinsey procedures. The
person inside a McKinsey device gets no indication that it's working.
More than that: After a procedure, the person who leaves a McKinsey
device has no memory of what happened inside. The effect is analogous
to some forms of anesthesia, or having a concussion, and is absolutely
essential for the safety of the subject's brain.</p>
<hr>
<p>“Come back! I see a blue blaze down this way,” Verona called out to
Adam. He turned and walked through the same dappled light again,
stepping on the same dry pine needles.</p>
<p>“This is why you should lead,” said Adam. “You're so good at finding
things! Maybe you can help find participants for the study too?”</p>
<p>“Are you really so surprised that people don't want to get
de-Guelphed?” Verona stopped to look at a patch of tiny white flowers
at the side of the trail.</p>
<p>“Who's to say mass isn't just as good as energy? Anyway nobody would
know the difference if we didn't tell them their initial test
results.” He looked up into the trees. “We'll get the subjects. People
are curious. It's really the regulations that slow everything down.”
Adam paused for a moment. “I got approval to run the protocol on
myself too.”</p>
<p>“Oh! You'll finally find out your status. Won't that be weird for
you?”</p>
<p>“In the end I know rationally it doesn't make a difference one way or
another.” Adam stopped to get something out of his boot, found
nothing, and put his boot back on. “I know you said you don't want to
be in the study, but if you want we can get you in for just the
initial test. We'll have the equipment for the day.”</p>
<p>“You want me there for moral support, huh? Sure. I wonder if people’s
eyes will look different, before and after.” The two walked on, up
stone steps that could have been natural or could have been put in,
matching the pace of the slowly shifting air.</p>
<hr>
<p>It is often repeated that a brain is a quantum computer that simulates
a brain. This is true in the same sense that a hammer is a quantum
computer that simulates a hammer. All matter is quantum, but this
doesn't imply that anything in particular is endowed with mysterious
properties on that basis.</p>
<p>Grover's search algorithm, number-theoretic results, uncomputation:
none of the uniquely quantum aspects of quantum computation are
particularly relevant to brain mechanics. Apart from some aspects of
parallelism, most components of brain simulation are more efficiently
implemented with traditional computers.</p>
<p>A quantum computer capable of running even a low-fidelity copy of a
human mind may never be technically feasible, but there is no reason
to expect that it would behave differently from a conventional
computer. A quantum computer is no more like a McKinsey device than a
regular digital computer.</p>
<hr>
<p>“It's darker with my eyes open!” When Verona spoke, their synchronized
breathing was no longer the dominant sound.</p>
<p>“And my senses were just starting to experience deprivation,” Adam
replied, with just a hint of a chuckle.</p>
<p>“What's the point of us being in here at the same time if we aren't
going to interact?”</p>
<p>“When I was booking this, the guy said that half the time there's only
one person using these two-person tanks. That's why it's such a good
deal when two people use one at the same time.”</p>
<p>“Oh.” Verona began to imagine all the kinds of lives that would
include floating naked in isolation.</p>
<p>“But yeah,” Adam replied again, “the dark is wild. I can almost forget
whether my eyes are open or closed. Some people say they get
hallucinations.”</p>
<p>Another topic came to Verona. “You really set it up so that we'll see
our results at the same time?”</p>
<p>“Hmm? Oh, right. Yeah, it's all my code. No problem. We'll find out
together.”</p>
<hr>
<p>In popular culture, Guelph theory has stirred the pot but not improved
the flavor, according to most. The problem of inclusion dominates
discussion.</p>
<p>The binary status of Guelph energy, combined with the relative
inaccessibility of legitimate testing, is taken by bigots for the
elaboration of hateful theories. The formula is that their preferred
group is Guelph positive while those they despise are negative (or,
more rarely, the reverse) and this can justify all manner of
atrocities.</p>
<p>The inclusion problem immediately confronts most philosophical
appropriations of Guelph theory. If Guelph energy is a mechanism for
free will, then why do only some people have it? Certainly this does
not resolve any problems in ethics.</p>
<p>To philosophers in the tradition of Dennett, Guelph energy is a red
herring, a distraction from anything that matters. The positive and
negative (unfortunate terms, really) can only be discriminated by
McKinsey device, not by introspection or any other behavior. Having a
second kind of thing in the brain changes nothing.</p>
<p>And since Guelph energy is still a phenomenon within the domain of
science, deterministic and described by equations, some look further
to a “third kind” that might finally explain everything that Guelph
theory does not.</p>
<p>For most, Guelph energy is just another mysterious part of the world,
like aurora and dreams and microwaves.</p>
<hr>
<p>“I love you,” said Adam into a microphone. They saw each other through
video monitors. Verona couldn't move her head, but every emotion
pulsed through her expression with the saccades of her eyes.</p>
<p>“Not like this,” she said. “I want to remember. Stop the experiment
and we can talk face to face.” Energy reflected off her eyes, into a
camera, through wires, off a screen, into Adam's eyes.</p>
<p>“It's already started,” said Adam. True to his word, he had programmed
the system to run without showing results, and it was running now.
Nobody used the emergency stop. What had been intended would be done.</p>
<p>Adam wasn't usually a gambler. But to ensure his experiment had
sufficient power to demonstrate the stimulated conversion of Guelph
energy to mass, he needed every Guelph positive participant he could
get. Between Adam and Verona, in expectation there was one subject.
The decision was already made in code. If he wasn't positive and she
was, she would join him in his doctoral experiment after all. Surely
she’d be okay with it. She knew how important this was. Professor Loi
was sure it was the right decision.</p>
<p>Whatever was happening in there now, he would tell her everything
afterward. The code was honest. There were no secrets between them.</p>
<hr>
<p>The largest religions have not changed policies regarding science and
have as much to say about Guelph theory as they do about electrolysis.
This does not prevent the religious from having their own beliefs on
the subject.</p>
<p>A few small religions, mostly for the super rich, admit only those who
have tested positive. Some claim a connection to Calvinism, and that
Guelph energy is evidence of predestined salvation.</p>
<p>Much more common, relatively, are religions that will certify Guelph
positive status without testing. These religions hold that their
certifications are more reliable than tests with a McKinsey device, so
they have no trouble resolving the odd contradictory result. Several
of these also claim a connection to Calvinism.</p>
<p>Neither religions that test before admittance nor those that certify
after joining seem to turn many people away, and data on Guelph energy
from any of them is generally not considered reliable by the
scientific community.</p>
<hr>
<p>“The phở tastes the same as always.” This is what Adam would have said
he was thinking, had anyone asked. He sat alone at the same small
white table. Phở had been their favorite.</p>
<p>The phở was hot. The noodles were chewy. The broth was salty. Sauce
added sweetness and a touch of sour. Umami-flavored protein floated at
the top.</p>
<p>Adam had never felt more alone.</p>
<p>As usual, he was surrounded by community here. So many people he
didn't know. He overheard but didn't understand snippets of Chinese at
a nearby table. He could turn on translation and join them, some day,
but for now it was a relief that the sounds died at his ears.</p>
<p>The lights were always so bright here, like an examination room. Like
the inside of a McKinsey chamber.</p>
<p>Adam tried to remember everything about Verona. What had it been that
made her so special? What was it that was gone, without her?</p>
<p>Had anyone asked, Adam would have said he was thinking that he'd never
know anyone like her again.</p>

<title>Solving a matching problem with OR-Tools CP-SAT</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>Optimizing matching for preference satisfaction often focuses on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_marriage_problem" title="Wikipedia: Stable marriage problem">stability</a>, which prioritizes individual interests. When maximizing
resource utilization is more important, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_programming" title="Wikipedia: Constraint programming">Constraint Programming</a>
(CP) can be used to find good matches. Google's <a href="https://developers.google.com/optimization" title="OR-Tools | Google Developers">OR-Tools</a> package
includes the <a href="https://developers.google.com/optimization/cp/cp_solver" title="CP-SAT Solver | OR-Tools | Google Developers">CP-SAT</a> solver, which is one way to implement this.</p>
<p>For example, we may be assigning a pool of interns to specific roles.
Managers for each role have ranked some of the candidates, and a
candidate can only be matched to a role for which they have been
ranked. Roles often have one spot to be filled, but some have more.
Candidates have been ranked for multiple roles, but can only be
assigned one.</p>
<p>This problem is similar to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Resident_Matching_Program" title="Wikipedia: National Resident Matching Program">medical residency matching</a> problem,
which famously applies the Nobel-prize-winning
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gale%E2%80%93Shapley_algorithm" title="Wikipedia: Gale–Shapley algorithm">Gale–Shapley algorithm</a>. One difference is that the present example
only has preferences from one side. Sometimes random preferences are
created in order to still allow the application of algorithms like
Gale–Shapley, but this will not be necessary here because there is a
bigger issue.</p>
<p>The salient difference between what Gale–Shapley does and the goal of
the example here is that we really want to fill every available role,
even if it means the match isn't perfectly stable. Gale–Shapley will
create a match that leaves some roles unfilled if this is necessary to
ensure that no trade would better satisfy the preferences of the
individuals involved. In general, Gale–Shapley will leave some roles
unfilled.</p>
<p>To begin a solution with the OR-Tools (OR for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_research" title="Wikipedia: Operations research">Operations Research</a>)
package, we start by converting the rankings to scores, where 1 is the
best and 0 is the worst: <a href="rankings.csv"><code>rankings.csv</code></a> (There are
different ways of doing this, like percentiles; here we assume we have
scores.)</p>
<pre><code>role,person,score
Role 23,Person 11,0.5238095238095238
Role 23,Person 109,0.7619047619047619
Role 23,Person 111,0.6190476190476191
...</code></pre>

<p>Each role has some maximum number of spots to fill: <a href="spots.csv"><code>spots.csv</code></a></p>
<pre><code>Role 23,4
Role 31,1
Role 8,1
...</code></pre>

<p>We can start reading in data using Python.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import csv

spots = {role: int(n) for role, n in csv.reader(open('spots.csv'))}
all_rankings = [ranking for ranking in csv.DictReader(open('rankings.csv'))]</code></pre>

<p>It will be convenient to have quick access to all the people ranked
for a role, and all the roles a person is ranked for.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">by_role, by_person = {}, {}

for ranking in all_rankings:
    by_role.setdefault(ranking['role'], []).append(ranking)
    by_person.setdefault(ranking['person'], []).append(ranking)</code></pre>

<p>Now we can start using OR-Tools.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from ortools.sat.python import cp_model

model = cp_model.CpModel()
solver = cp_model.CpSolver()</code></pre>

<p>The matching will be represented via a Boolean variable for each
ranking that is true to select that match and false otherwise.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">for ranking in all_rankings:
    ranking['selected'] = model.NewBoolVar('')</code></pre>

<p>OR-Tools lets us use natural Python expressions to express
constraints. First, we dictate that each role should have no more than
the allowed number of people.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">for role, rankings in by_role.items():
    total = sum(ranking['selected'] for ranking in rankings)
    model.Add(total &lt;= spots[role])</code></pre>

<p>Similarly, we require that each person is matched with at most one
role.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">for person, rankings in by_person.items():
    total = sum(ranking['selected'] for ranking in rankings)
    model.Add(total &lt;= 1)</code></pre>

<p>The objective will be to maximize the total score of selected matches.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">total_score = 0
for ranking in all_rankings:
    score = float(ranking['score']) * ranking['selected']
    total_score += score</code></pre>

<p>At this point, we need only ask for the solution.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">model.Maximize(total_score)
status = solver.Solve(model)
print(solver.Value(total_score), solver.StatusName(status))
# 82.87644300144302 OPTIMAL</code></pre>

<p>You can check that every role has its maximal number of people, and
every person has one role (or zero; this example has more people than
spots). The CP-SAT solver has done the heavy lifting of finding a
solution and even guaranteeing that it is optimal.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">with open('results.csv', 'w') as f:
    writer = csv.DictWriter(f, all_rankings[0].keys())
    writer.writeheader()
    for ranking in all_rankings:
        ranking['selected'] = solver.Value(ranking['selected'])
        writer.writerow(ranking)</code></pre>

<p>Code is also available in a <a href="https://github.com/ajschumacher/ajschumacher.github.io/blob/master/20230316-solving_a_matching_problem_with_ortools_cpsat/matching.ipynb">notebook</a>. Writing out results
produces: <a href="results.csv"><code>results.csv</code></a></p>
<pre><code>role,person,score,selected
Role 23,Person 11,0.5238095238095238,0
...
Role 23,Person 41,0.5714285714285714,1
...</code></pre>

<p>The approach here is general enough that with modifications it can be
applied to a wide range of more or less related problems. There is
always a question of whether the chosen metric is the right one to
optimize, but making some choice can get you pretty far toward a good
solution, with a solver that makes optimization easy. Indeed, what
other problems might be formulated in a manner amenable to solving in
this way? OR-Tools are handy!</p>
<hr>
<p>Thanks to Maxime Labonne, whose Linear Programming <a href="https://github.com/mlabonne/Linear-Programming-Course" title="Hands-on course about linear programming and mathematical optimization.">course</a> was very
helpful as I started to use OR-Tools.</p>

<title>Pity the Reader, by McConnell</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>Vonnegut is the headline, and there are a lot of quotes, but it's
McConnell's book: elegy, eulogy, paean. I was down on the man a little
after I read about his affair in a biography years ago, but this
reminded me of his quality.</p>
<p>Vonnegut was an activist author, which I think is good. He was also an
entertainer and technician. Too much writing might as well come from
ChatGPT: predictable word after word. "Don’t be predictable. End your
sentences with something unexpected. Keep me awake." (page 195) A good
sentence delights you with pleasant thrills like a fresh ski run. On
writing with style: keep the entropy low.</p>
<p><img alt="cover" src="cover.jpg"></p>
<p>In the following quotes, I make no attempt to clarify whether they
come from Vonnegut or McConnell or a character etc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"fiction is melody, and journalism, new or old, is noise." (page 44)</p>
<p>"Vonnegut earned no degree in anthropology." (page 52)</p>
<p>"Commitment invites Fate to be your Fairy Godmother Collaborator, to
close and open just the doors you need." (page 76)</p>
<p>"I once read an interview with John Barth and Kurt Vonnegut and
others in which Vonnegut stated that the reason all writers write,
of course, is that they want to change the world. Whereupon Barth
objected. No, he said. That wasn’t why he wrote. As I recall, Barth
said, in effect, that he just liked to horse around with words."
(page 84)</p>
<p>"Our awareness is all that is alive and maybe sacred in any of us."
(page 93)</p>
<p>"Writing is a generosity, even to yourself." (page 94)</p>
<p>"Vonnegut considered Galápagos his best book, by the way. Because
his canary-in-the-coal-mine is on urgent tweet." (page 119)</p>
<p>"Writers who are swoopers, it seems to me, find it wonderful that
people are funny or tragic or whatever, worth reporting, without
wondering why or how people are alive in the first place. Bashers,
while ostensibly making sentence after sentence as efficient as
possible, may actually be breaking down seeming doors and fences,
cutting their ways through seeming barbed-wire entanglements, under
fire and in an atmosphere of mustard gas, in search of answers to
these eternal questions: “What in heck should we be doing? What in
heck is really going on?”" (page 171)</p>
<p>"The young man did not appear to be listening to his own radio. He
may not even have understood English. The newscaster spoke with a
barking sort of hilarity, as though life were a comical
steeplechase, with unconventional steeds and hazards and vehicles
involved. He made me feel that even I was a contestant—in a bathtub
drawn by three aardvarks, perhaps. I had as good a chance as anybody
to win." (page 176)</p>
<p>"You have to play by the rules of the game of fiction well enough so
that you can get across what is in the rag-and-bone shop of your
heart. You have to be like a magician or pickpocket, distracting the
audience by entertaining, while you are really saying those things
you most want to say." (page 189)</p>
<p>"I don’t praise plots as accurate representations of life, but as
ways to keep readers reading." (page 202)</p>
<p>"“The thing Kurt seemed to want most in a story,” his student Ronni
Sandroff recalls, “was to be surprised. He once challenged us to
pause before we turned to the next page in a book and try to guess
how the sentence we were in the middle of would end. “You’ll almost
always get it right,” he said." (page 212)</p>
<p>"He warned against tiresomeness. He urged originality, freshness."
(page 212)</p>
<p>"Nothing in real life ends. “Millicent at last understands.” Nobody
ever understands." (page 215)</p>
<p>"it strikes me as gruesome and comical that in our culture we have
an expectation that a man can always solve his problems. There is
that implication that if you just have a little more energy, a
little more fight, the problem can always be solved. This is so
untrue that it makes me want to cry—or laugh." (page 270)</p>
<p>"“Since I took up carpentry,” Mark the pediatrician avows, “I
measure children much more carefully, sometimes to 1/32 of an
inch.”" (page 351)</p>

<title>The Voltage Effect, by List</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>The subtitle is "How to make good ideas great and great ideas scale,"
but a lot of it is about how to avoid bad ideas. The "Five Vital
Signs" are really five kinds of problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reliability: Thinking a test is promising when it's not: "Dupers
   and false positives"</li>
<li>Validity of a test sample: "Know your audience" or "overestimating
   how big a slice of the pie your idea can capture" or
   "representativeness of population"</li>
<li>Scalability of the treatment: "situational validity" or "unscalable
   ingredients" and "program drift" and "noncompliance"</li>
<li>Unintended consequences: "Spillovers"</li>
<li>Just too expensive: "The cost trap"</li>
</ol>
<p>Problems 4 and 5 could be special cases of 3.</p>
<p>Then there are four chapters that have some more positive
recommendations:</p>
<ol>
<li>"using behavioral-economic incentives"</li>
<li>"exploiting easily missed opportunities on the margins of your operation"</li>
<li>"knowing when to quit in the short term in order to win in the long term"</li>
<li>"culture that is sustainable at scale"</li>
</ol>
<p>It's a pop economics book. Marginal revolution, comparative advantage,
anecdotes from academia and Uber and Lyft and government. It's not
awful, but I didn't feel like it delivered quite what it promised.</p>
<p><img alt="cover" src="cover.jpg"></p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Through my research and time working with policymakers, my personal
credo had become that the only ideas worth pursuing are the ones
with the potential to make a significant impact on human lives."
(page 6)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"... the one thing all great ideas have in common is that they are
not guaranteed to succeed. ... the path from early promise to
widespread impact requires one thing and one thing only:
<em>scalability</em>—the capacity to grow and expand in a robust and
sustainable way." (page 9)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is this a contradiction? Great ideas may or may not be scalable? But
wouldn't a good idea be better if it was scalable?</p>
<p>Bad scalable ideas seem clearly allowed.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"(a charity will attract more donations in the short run <em>and</em> long
run if they attract initial donors by promising to never bother them
again rather than with the traditional strategy of constant
follow-ups)" (page 10)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reference is <a href="https://spihub.org/site/resource_files/publications/spi_wp_025_list.pdf" title="Once and Done: Leveraging Behavioral Economicsto Increase Charitable Contributions">Once and Done</a> and I wonder whether it's been
replicated. The effect they find is strong, but their experiment is
with Smile Train, whose mailers include prominent photos of children
with cleft palates. The authors offered mechanism includes that "a
solicitation by a charity imposes a cost on the recipient," and in the
case of Smile Train that cost may be particularly high and not due
only to social pressure.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"The book calls upon policy-makers to move their attention from
evidence-based policy to policy-based evidence." (page 15)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>List seems to want to make this his catch-phrase. It's repeated on (at
least) pages 15, 63, 87, and 233. I don't think it works as a slogan
because, for one, it isn't terribly clear. I <em>think</em> he's advocating
for program evaluation?</p>

<p>"Based on my experience with the baseball fundraising, one would
expect that making salaries transparent could drive resentful
demoralization if people saw peers making more. But that is not the
full story." (page 99)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He found that when he randomly paid some people less (for an identical
job) and they found out by talking to others, those paid less worked
less hard.</p>
<p>The more to the story he references is a study where when people
learned their managers made more than they thought, they worked
harder.</p>

<title>The Ten Equations that Rule the World, by Sumpter</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p><a href="https://www.david-sumpter.com/" title="David Sumpter">Sumpter</a> has Bill Nye applied math energy. His central gimmick—a
secret society of people who know math—is a bit much. He's most
interesting when connecting equations and philosophy, but he likes
logical positivism more than his hero Ayers <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language,_Truth,_and_Logic#Ayer's_later_rejection_of_logical_positivism" title="Wikipedia: Ayer's later rejection of logical positivism">did</a>, and his ultimate
appeal to ethical intuitionism is unsatisfying. Still very interesting
in places, and I'm generally with him.</p>
<p>I like the core idea of trying to distill a lot of understanding into
a few core concepts. I think Sumpter's book highlights both the
promise and challenge of attempting this.</p>
<p><img alt="cover" src="cover.jpg"></p>
<p>Here are the names Sumpter uses for his equations (and more
conventional names):</p>
<ol>
<li>The Judgment Equation (Bayes' theorem)</li>
<li>The Betting Equation (Logistic regression)</li>
<li>The Confidence Equation (Normal confidence intervals)</li>
<li>The Skill Equation (Markov property; memorylessness)</li>
<li>The Influencer Equation (Stationary distribution; PageRank)</li>
<li>The Market Equation (A sort of autoregressive differential model?)</li>
<li>The Advertising Equation (Correlation coefficient)</li>
<li>The Reward Equation (Exponential moving average; Q-learning)</li>
<li>The Learning Equation (Derivative of quadratic loss; gradient
   descent)</li>
<li>The Universal Equation (If-then; trying to get from "is" to
    "ought")</li>
</ol>
<p>With the exception of #6, I was reasonably familiar with all of these.
My failure to feel connected to the literature (or even what a common
name might be) for #6 makes me feel that this book might not be the
best way to encounter these ideas for the first time.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"The first lesson to draw from Bayes's rule, the judgment equation,
is that we should be slow to draw definitive conclusions." (page 15)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Many people think of math as being all about objectivity; it's not.
It is a way of representing and arguing about the world, and
sometimes the things we argue about are known only to us." (page 24)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He's a professor of applied math, after all.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Much of mathematical modeling is about dividing the world into
understandable component parts, ..." (page 63)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"What I hadn't understood when I started working with sports
statistics was just how much time I would have to sit listening to
men telling me why they believed they were the special one." (page
85)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"When Andrey Markov first wrote down his equation, he wasn't
interested in modeling sporting excellence. He was interested in
great literature. In 1913, he presented, at the Russian Royal
Academy of Sciences, an analysis of the first chapter and parts of
the second chapter of Pushkin's novel <em>Eugene Onegin.</em> In his
analysis of these twenty thousand Russian letters, he determined the
probability of sequences of vowels and consonants. He constructed a
model that predicted, based on the letter that had just occurred in
a text, whether a vowel or a consonant was more likely to occur as
the next character. In doing so, Markov had created a model for
creating new Pushkin works, one character at a time." (page 92)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Neat! I think I hadn't heard this story before.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Accurate reporting of assumptions is just as important as accurate
reporting of results." (page 99)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"The salaries offered by tech giants were enough to lure even the
purest of mathematicians." (page 113)</p>

<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"The division of the world into models, data, and nonsense gave the
members of TEN a sense of certainty." (page 122)</p>

<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"I had researched Cambridge Analytica's algorithm in detail during
2017, the year before the scandal broke, and reached a conclusion

They had certainly tried, but the methods they claimed to have used
to target voters were flawed." (page 146)</p>
<p>"Working on the inside, he [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Kogan_(scientist)" title="Wikipedia: Aleksandr Kogan (scientist)">Alex Kogan</a>] had reached the same
conclusion about Cambridge Analytica as I had. He phrased it
politely at the Senate hearing. To me, he said, “That shit doesn't
work.”" (page 164)</p>
<p>"Instead of looking for the real reasons for the rise of
nationalistic sentiment that had brought Donald Trump to power, that
had caused Brexit, that was responsible for the Five Star movement
in Italy, Viktor Orbán in Hungary, and Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil,
everyone seemed to be rushing to find a James Bond-type villain, an
evil individual who had poisoned the political waters. Their Dr. No
came in the form of Alexander Nix and his company, Cambridge
Analytica. Somehow this man, with only a basic understanding of
models and data, was seen to have manipulated the whole of modern
democracy." (page 168)</p>

arguing with his principle of verifiability that we can't expect to
find any answers to moral questions in math. A mathematics that is

<p>"The sheer number of mathematical theorems that have proved to be
true led French mathematician Henri Poincaré to reflect in his 1902
book, <em>Science and Hypothesis,</em> that “if all the assertions which
mathematics puts forward can be derived from one another by formal
logic, mathematics cannot amount to anything more than an immense
tautology. Logical inference can teach us nothing essentially new
... But can we really allow that these theorems which fill so many
books serve no other purpose than to say in a roundabout fashion
that ‘A = A’?”" (page 214)</p>
<p>"In response to the rhetorical tone used by Poincaré, Ayer wrote,
“The power of logic and mathematics to surprise us depends, like
their usefulness, on the limitations of our reason.”" (page 216)</p>

dilemmas: we should learn to trust and use our own ethical
intuitions." (page 222)</p>

positivism strips away the idea of a universal utilitarianism, we
are left with moral intuition to guide us. It is this soft way of
thinking that tells us which problems to solve." (page 223)</p>

<title>Predicting the future from 2023</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>I've tried to predict the future the last three years: <a href="/20200112-predicting_the_future_from_2020/" title="Predicting the future from 2020">2020</a>,
<a href="/20210102-predicting_the_future_from_2021/" title="Predicting the future from 2021">2021</a>, <a href="/20220101-predicting_the_future_from_2022/)" title="Predicting the future from 2022">2022</a>. I think that's probably enough for now. Here are
some 2023 <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/1/2/23494204/biden-trump-putin-supreme-court-2023-predictions" title="23 things we think will happen in 2023">predictions from Vox</a>, if you want.</p>
<p>If you make new predictions every year, you end up with a lot of them.
I managed to have at least one set of <em>conflicting</em> predictions in
just three years.</p>
<p>The big trends don't change that much year to year, and I've already
thought about those some. Many of them are clear enough that even a
large language model knows them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What are important trends for the next five to ten years?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="ChatGPT" src="chatgpt.jpg"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is difficult to predict specific trends with certainty, as many
factors can influence the course of events. However, some possible
trends that could affect the world over the next five to ten years
include the continued rise of artificial intelligence and

Almost certainly yes, but it's a little scary.</p>

<title>Echopraxia, by Watts</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>Here's Watts' follow-up to <a href="/20221224-blindsight_by_watts/" title="Blindsight, by Watts">Blindsight</a>. Blindsight is about
consciousness, and Echopraxia largely is too, but it may have been
intended to also be about free will (except Watts didn't find it that
interesting) and ends up largely more of the same cosmic horror,
ret-conning the narrator from Blindsight into the new alien invasion
story. It's more fun apocalipsia.</p>

<title>Blindsight, by Watts</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>Thanks to an <a href="https://www.meetup.com/machine-learning-paper-club/events/289756240/" title="Meetup: AIBC: Happy New Year Book Club!">invite</a>, I finally read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindsight_(Watts_novel)" title="Wikipedia: Blindsight (Watts novel)">Blindsight</a>, by Peter
Watts. It's good. The central what-if is about whether consciousness
is necessary (or even helpful) for intelligent behavior.</p>
<p>In this diagram, every quadrant exhibits intelligent behavior:</p>
<p><img alt="diagram" src="diagram.png"></p>
<p>I think Watts uses the term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room" title="Wikipedia: Chinese room">Chinese Room</a> to mean something
different from what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Searle" title="Wikipedia: John Searle">Searle</a> (and even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Dennett" title="Wikipedia: Daniel Dennett">Dennett</a>) mean. Searle's
Chinese Room is a kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_zombie" title="Wikipedia: Philosophical zombie">philosophical zombie</a>, with linguistic
behavior indistinguishable from that of a conscious human, but no
consciousness. Dennett <a href="https://planspace.org/20220918-consciousness_explained_by_dennett/" title="Consciousness Explained, by Dennett">says</a> the Chinese Room <em>is</em> conscious, which
is the kind of nonsense that will get you <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/07/22/google-ai-lamda-blake-lemoine-fired/" title="Washington Post: Google fired engineer who said its AI was sentient">fired from Google</a>.
Watt's aliens ("scramblers" and related systems) are empirically
distinguishable from humans in their use of language, and he says
they're a Chinese Room example because of this. That's a different
meaning for the term.</p>
<p>We usually imagine intelligent aliens as being conscious, like humans,
and Watts's idea is to imagine aliens that are intelligent but not
conscious, like evolved computers, in the same category where I would
put all AI. Could this happen?</p>
<p>If nothing else, the book invites thought on how we view
consciousness. We generally accept that other humans are conscious,
not philosophical zombies. If we met an intelligent alien, would we so
easily assume its consciousness? Would this be important to how we
interact with it? How do we think of animal consciousness and what
this means ethically? Is it possible for AI to be conscious?</p>
<p>Definitely interesting enough that I'll read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echopraxia_(novel)" title="Wikipedia: Echopraxia (novel)">Echopraxia</a> too.</p>
<p><img alt="cover" src="cover.jpg"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"After four thousand years we can’t even prove that reality exists
beyond the mind of the first-person dreamer." (page 52)</p>

<title>Why greatness cannot be planned (Stanley and Lehman)</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>There are a lot of ways to misunderstand The Myth of the Objective. I
take it as a useful meditation, with aspects of
<a href="/20200425-tyranny_of_metrics_by_muller/">The Tyranny of Metrics</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Against_Method">Against Method</a>, encouraging
exploration. Be flexible, be curious, don't follow a plan for the sake
of following a plan.</p>
<p>I don't recall these AI researchers ever talking about local maxima or
explore/exploit trade-offs explicitly, as they seem to be trying to
write for a broad audience. Natural evolution, human innovation,
<a href="https://nbenko1.github.io/">Picbreeder</a>, and novelty search are their examples of unplanned
greatness. They point out that evolution is about <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0702207104" title="The frailty of adaptive hypotheses for the origins of organismal complexity">exploration</a> as
much as adaptation, and critique the dominance in the AI community of
the experimentalist and theoretical heuristics.</p>
<p>Is a goal local (we know how to get there) or is it "great" (requiring
steps into the unknown)? The authors are saying that if it's the
latter, we're better off exploring via other heuristics than focusing
only on a particular distant imagined goal.</p>
<p>They talk about "interestingness" a lot, and I think a missing note is
that "interesting" shouldn't necessarily <em>exclude</em> a sense of what
takes us closer to some distant goal.</p>
<p>We should also be watching for opportunities to take things in a
different direction: if you find a path to something great on your way
to something good, you can follow that path! (Don't let the good be
the enemy of the great.)</p>
<p>I've sometimes been apologetic about the winding path of my life and
career, as if I should have had a plan from the start and followed it
without distraction. Would that have been better? I'm not sure. This
book makes me think that a life or career built from a kit represents
a failure to identify opportunities. What are the odds there was never
a way to improve on an earlier plan? Blinders make you faster, but
they limit where you go.</p>
<p>The book applies most to the "research" setting—where we really don't
know what the future is going to hold, where we don't know the
mechanics or topology of the search space. Objectives such as
"hovercraft like in Star Wars" or "economy like in Star Trek." There
are a lot of other things we'll find before we find these, and that's
not a bad thing.</p>
<p><img alt="cover" src="cover.jpg"></p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"The idea that all our pursuits can be distilled into neatly-defined
objectives and then almost mechanically pursued offers a kind of
comfort against the harsh unpredictability of life." (page 2)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"... meeting a constraint is much different from what is usually
<em>meant</em> by objective-driven achievement." (page 34)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"The best way to get computation is not to force great minds to
waste their lives pondering a distant dream, but to let the great
minds pursue their own interests in their present reality." (page
36)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is in the example of developing computers, but the idea is one
that I feel applies especially well to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism">Effective Altruism</a>.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Deception applies to becoming rich just as everywhere else. For
example, what sense would it make to decline an unpaid internship
doing something you love simply because it doesn't make you any more
rich? In fact, if you do become rich, it's probably because you
<em>did</em> pursue your passion, not because you pursued money per se.
Passion is what drives you to that point, and then one day you might
realize that you are only one stepping stone away from being rich.
And <em>that</em> is the moment, when you are one stepping stone away, when
you make the move you need to make and become rich. But becoming
rich didn't guide every life decision up to that point. On the
contrary, a single-minded preoccupation with money is likely exactly
the wrong road to abundant wealth." (page 37)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So... This works for some people. But it certainly doesn't work for
everyone.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"There's much we cannot achieve by trying to achieve it." (page 38)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"... being aimless isn't <em>always</em> a good idea, but when it's paired
with a thirst for exploration, it might indeed hint at great
potential." (page 68)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>On page 70, the authors mention that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_DeMarco" title="Tom DeMarco">DeMarco</a>, who I know as the
author of <a href="/20200523-peopleware_productive_projects_and_teams/" title="Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams">Peopleware</a>, is also responsible for "You can't control
what you can't measure" in the earlier
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Controlling-Software-Projects-Management-Measurement/dp/0131717111">Controlling software projects</a>. What a different perspective,
between these two books! The authors here focus on his much later
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100801083400/http://www2.computer.org/cms/Computer.org/ComputingNow/homepage/2009/0709/rW_SO_Viewpoints.pdf">Software Engineering: An Idea Whose Time Has Come and Gone?</a>, which
I like a lot.</p>
<hr>
<p>Page 71 has a bit about evaluating higher ed with the Collegiate
Learning Assessment (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collegiate_Learning_Assessment">CLA</a>) and the Collegiate Assessment of
Academic Proficiency (CAAP).</p>
<p>For the CAAP, the only info I can find is on individual schools' sites
(<a href="https://www.wabash.edu/alumni/news.cfm?news_ID=2641">example</a>) and the <a href="http://www.act.org/caap">link</a> to ACT redirects to a page that doesn't
mention it. Is CAAP defunct? (Are they both?)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Splitting experts may be more of an achievement than unifying
them." (page 82)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is about expert review of proposals. May.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Some readers will detect a hint of Paul Feyerabend in this
argument—he taught that science can't be distilled to any one
objective methodology." (page 87)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Feyerabend" title="Paul Feyerabend">Feyerabend</a>'s book on this is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Against_Method">Against Method</a>. It's related in
the following way, I think: Feyerabend is saying we can't limit the
methods for getting to the next stepping stones. Stanley and Lehman
are saying we can't know which stepping stones will help us reach
further stepping stones. Ignoring either will limit where we can go.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The only principle that does not inhibit progress is: anything
goes." (page 119, quoting Feyerabend in Against Method)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"The successful inventor asks where we can get from <em>here</em> rather
than how we can get <em>there</em>." (page 97)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I connect this to my <a href="/20181204-worth_doing_even_if_it_fails/">Is it worth doing even if it fails?</a> In the
language of the book, things that are worth doing are things that can
be stepping stones: "succeed" or "fail" you learn something to build
on.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"When there's <em>no destination</em> there <em>can't be a right path</em>." (page
98)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"So if you're wondering how to escape the myth of the objective,
just do things because they're interesting. Not everything needs to
be guided by rigid objectives. If you have a strong feeling, go with
it. If you don't have a clear objective, then you can't be wrong,
because wherever you end up is okay. Assessment only goes so far. A
great achievement is one that leads to more great achievements. If
you set out to program computers but you're now making movies,
you're probably doing something right." (page 99)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's not just fun to have interests, it's useful. It expands the space
of stepping stones that you can build from.</p>
<p>It's also about motivation, isn't it? You're more likely to do more if
you're interested in doing it. And if you do more, you're more likely
to do more good things (hopefully).</p>
<p>If you're hiring, would you rather hire somebody with broad and active
interests? (Is this some part of "Googleyness"? Looks like that's
supposed to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-googleyness-hiring-training-guide-change-2019-10">include</a> "enjoying fun" and "evidence that you've taken
some courageous or interesting paths in your life," which could be
related.)</p>
<hr>

them.</em>" (page 100)</p>

<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"While a new interpretation could imply that the earlier
interpretations were <em>wrong</em>, in reality the same set of data can
support more than one interpretation. So just being consistent with
the data isn't enough to decide between competing interpretations."
(page 111)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This relates to <a href="/20170825-characteristics_of_good_theories/">Characteristics of good theories</a>, which continues
to surprise me by being one of the most popular things on my blog.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Seen this way, evolution is a special kind of non-objective search:
a <em>minimal criteria search</em>." (page 114)</p>

<p>Page 126 quotes from Hooker's 1995
<a href="http://akira.ruc.dk/~keld/teaching/algoritmedesign_f03/Artikler/01/Hooker95.pdf">Testing Heuristics: We Have It All Wrong</a>: "Most experimental
studies of heuristic algorithms resemble track meets more than
scientific endeavors."</p>
<p>This is a critique applicable to modern AI work, but modern AI is also
making tons of progress, often in harmony with benchmarking. New tests
are introduced, and new models come out that do them really well. How
separate are research and development, really?</p>
<p>I think <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Marcus" title="Gary Marcus">Marcus</a> makes related arguments that this focus on
benchmarks may still prevent needed and very different work... Could
be. It's hard to argue with the success of the benchmark-oriented work
though. I guess the real message isn't "stop that" but "let's also."</p>

shaky at best for researchers—because of deception." (page 129)</p>

<title>Draft No. 4: On the Writing Process, by McPhee</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>The New Yorker's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McPhee">John McPhee</a> has collected essays about writing
nonfiction. It's largely show-don't-tell advice to write better, in
that he writes very well as he tells you about writing. It's a brief
and charming grandfatherly memoir from a confident practitioner.</p>
<p><img alt="cover" src="cover.jpg"></p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"To some extent, the structure of a composition dictates itself, and
to some extent it does not." (page 20)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"O.K. then, what is a lead? For one thing, the lead is the hardest
part of a story to write. And it is not impossible to write a very
bad one. Here is an egregiously bad one from an article on chronic
sleeplessness. It began: “Insomnia is the triumph of mind over
mattress.” Why is that bad? It’s not bad at all if you want to be a
slapstick comedian—if humor, at that stratum, is your purpose. If
you are serious about the subject, you might seem to be indicating
at the outset that you don’t have confidence in your material so you
are trying to make up for it by waxing cute." (pages 49-50)</p>
<p>"A lead should not be cheap, flashy, meretricious, blaring. After a
tremendous fanfare of verbal trumpets, a mouse comes out of a hole
blinking." (page 50)</p>
<p>"Blind leads—wherein you withhold the name of the person you are
writing about and reveal it after a paragraph or two—range from
slightly cheap to very cheap." (page 50)</p>
<p>"A lead is good not because it dances, fires cannons, or whistles
like a train but because it is absolute to what follows." (page 51)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Another mantra, which I still write in chalk on the blackboard, is
“A Thousand Details Add Up to One Impression.” It’s actually a quote
from Cary Grant. Its implication is that few (if any) details are
individually essential, while the details collectively are
absolutely essential." (page 56)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Writing is a matter strictly of developing oneself." (page 82)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Editors have come along who use terms like “nut graph”—as in “What
this piece needs is a good nut graph”—meaning a paragraph close to
the beginning that encapsulates the subject and why you are writing
about it. That sort of structural formalism is a part of the rote
methodology that governs the thought of people who don’t have better
ideas." (page 82)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Editors are counselors and can do a good deal more for writers in
the first-draft stage than at the end of the publishing process."
(page 83)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"The last thing I would ever suggest to young writers is that they
consciously try to write for the ages. Oh, yik, disgusting. Nobody
should ever be trying that." (page 119)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Without the drafted version—if it did not exist—you obviously would
not be thinking of things that would improve it. In short, you may
be actually writing only two or three hours a day, but your mind, in
one way or another, is working on it twenty-four hours a day—yes,
while you sleep—but only if some sort of draft or earlier version
already exists. Until it exists, writing has not really begun."
(pages 159-260)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Forget market research. Never market-research your writing." (page 180)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Creative nonfiction is not making something up but making the most
of what you have." (page 185)</p>

<title>Mindf*ck, by Wylie</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>Cambridge Analytica was a US brand for the UK's SCL (Strategic
Communication Laboratories) Group. They <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal" title="Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal">got</a> Americans to fill out
personality surveys and install an app that sent them Facebook
information on likes, friends, etc. They used all this to advance the
agendas of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Bannon">Steve Bannon</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mercer" title="Robert Mercer">Bob Mercer</a>, for example.</p>
<p>Facebook's crime in this seems to have been basically negligence. They
let a lot of information be accessible at the time, and people did
unsavory things with it. It's a little weird to call it a data breach,
since the system was working as intended.</p>
<p>I wonder how (or whether) Cambridge Analytica evaluated their
effectiveness... Trump became president, but was it <em>because of</em>
Cambridge Analytica? Or were they just pushing in a direction that
already had momentum? It is both horrifying and attractive to think
that manipulative actors are responsible for massive unpleasant
outcomes. But what share of the blame can be assigned?</p>

multi-agent systems to "grow" societies in silico. I could remember
as a teenager reading Isaac Asimov's <a href="https://planspace.org/20200714-foundation_trilogy/" title="Asimov's Foundation trilogy"><em>Foundation</em></a> series, where
scientists used large data sets about societies to create the field
of "psychohistory," which allowed them to not only predict the
future but also control it." (page 81)</p>

neuroticism and dark-triad traits, and those who were more prone to
impulsive anger or conspiratorial thinking than average citizens.

<p>Some of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits">Big Five personality traits</a> stuff reminded me of what
I've heard about <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Righteous-Mind-Divided-Politics-Religion/dp/0307455777/">The Righteous Mind</a>: describing Republicans as low
on openness and high on conscientiousness, while Democrats are the
reverse.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Cambridge Analytica's research panels also identified that there
were relationships between target attitudes and a psychological
effect called the <em>just-world hypothesis</em> (JWH). This is a cognitive
bias where some people rely on a presumption of a fair world: The
world is a fair place where bad things "happen for a reason" or will
be offset by some sort of "moral balancing" in the universe. We
found that people who displayed the JWH bias were, for example, more
prone to victim-blaming in hypothetical scenarios of sexual assault.
If the world is fair, then random bad things should not happen to
innocent people, and therefore there must have been a fault in the
victim's behavior. Finding ways to blame victims is psychologically
prophylactic for some people because it helps them cope with anxiety
induced by uncontrollable environmental threats while maintaining a
comforting view that the world will still be fair <em>to them</em>.</p>
<p>"Cambridge Analytica found that JWH was related to many attitudes,
but that it had a special relationship with racial bias." (page 129)</p>

<title>Consciousness Explained, by Dennett</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>Dennett takes materialism as an axiom and uses it to prove there is no
dualist, soul-like consciousness, no audience in a “Cartesian
theater.” He thinks that if you imagine a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_zombie">philosophical zombie</a>,
then you're imagining too hard, and if you don't think the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room">Chinese room</a> is conscious, then you aren't imagining hard enough.
His argument is that the brain must be where consciousness comes from,
and we know what kind of things are in the brain, so consciousness
must be from all that: lots of simple things together generate
consciousness and there's nothing more to the story. I don't feel like
it's explained.</p>
<p>Do I ask too much of an explanation of consciousness? Science is
fundamentally descriptive, after all. Maxwell's equations (etc.) don't
explain <em>why</em> electromagnetism (etc.) is the way it is. They don't
really explain <em>how</em> it works. Every theory is vulnerable to a child
repeatedly asking “why.” This is the kind of infinite regress Dennett
is trying to avoid. And yet, I am conscious. This <em>experience</em> is the
phenomenon of interest. Being able to <em>have</em> experiences. I don't
think there's anything being a magnet is like, but there is something
being me is like, and I'm not convinced Dennett explains the
difference.</p>
<p>It seems very much like a riff on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_Mind">Society of Mind</a>, which I should
probably read as well, though I don't know whether it will be more
persuasive. Do people consider this a settled issue? At least in the
popular press, folks are still <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.co.za/science/quantum-physics-could-finally-explain-consciousness-scientists-say/" title="Quantum Physics Could Finally Explain Consciousness, Scientists Say">pitching</a> weird ideas and describing
consciousness as a “deep and abiding philosophical problem.” Is
Dennett's explanation bad, or do I just not want to understand?</p>
<p>For the most part, I think Dennett is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_even_wrong">not even wrong</a>, because he
isn't explaining what he promises to. It is a challenge, though, to
imagine what explanation (between Dennett and dualism) I would prefer.</p>
<p><img alt="cover" src="cover.jpg"></p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"One conclusion we can draw from this is that we are not brains in
vats—in case you were worried." (page 7)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He's arguing this is the case because it would be too computationally
expensive to simulate a world, based on the graphics of Donkey Kong
being crummy. Perhaps this seemed convincing in 1991?</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"And, as with all the earlier mysteries, there are many who
insist—and hope—that there will never be a demystification of
consciousness." (page 22)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I do have some sympathy for this critique... What <em>would</em> a
satisfactory explanation look like?</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"The challenge is to construct a theory of mental events, using the
data that scientific method permits. Such a theory will have to be
constructed from the third-person point of view, since all science
is constructed from that perspective." (page 71)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Suppose you are confronted by a “speaking” computer, and suppose
you succeed in interpreting its output as speech acts expressing its
beliefs and opinions, presumably “about” its conscious states. The
fact that there is a single, coherent interpretation of a sequence
of behavior doesn’t establish that the interpretation is true; it
might be only as if the “subject” were conscious; we risk being
taken in by a zombie with no inner life at all. You could not
confirm that the computer was conscious of anything by this method
of interpretation. Fair enough. We can’t be sure that the speech
acts we observe express real beliefs about actual experiences;
perhaps they express only apparent beliefs about nonexistent
experiences. Still, the fact that we had found even one stable
interpretation of some entity’s behavior as speech acts would always
be a fact worthy of attention." (page 78)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you agree with Dennett, then do you agree that Google's
<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/google-engineer-claims-ai-chatbot-is-sentient-why-that-matters/" title="Google Engineer Claims AI Chatbot Is Sentient: Why That Matters">LaMDA is conscious</a>? According to Dennett, it might as well be, and
he doesn't identify any method for distinguishing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Other people, however, find the implication that there could be, in
principle, a conscious robot so incredible that it amounts in their
eyes to the reductio ad absurdum of my theory." (page 432)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"the famous four F’s (fight, flee, feed, or mate)" (page 188)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hadn't heard this one before.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Here is the hypothesis I will defend: Human consciousness is itself
a huge complex of memes (or more exactly, meme-effects in brains)
that can best be understood as the operation of a “von Neumannesque”
virtual machine implemented in the parallel architecture of a brain
that was not designed for any such activities. The powers of this
virtual machine vastly enhance the underlying powers of the organic
hardware on which it runs, but at the same time many of its most
curious features, and especially its limitations, can be explained
as the byproducts of the kludges that make possible this curious but
effective reuse of an existing organ for novel purposes." (page 210)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"But still (I am sure you want to object): All this has little or
nothing to do with consciousness! After all, a von Neumann machine
is entirely unconscious; why should implementing it—or something
like it: a Joycean machine—be any more conscious? I do have an
answer: The von Neumann machine, by being wired up from the outset
that way, with maximally efficient informational links, didn’t have
to become the object of its own elaborate perceptual systems. The
workings of the Joycean machine, on the other hand, are just as
“visible” and “audible” to it as any of the things in the external
world that it is designed to perceive—for the simple reason that
they have much of the same perceptual machinery focused on them. Now
this appears to be a trick with mirrors, I know." (page 225)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"With so many idiots working on the problem, no wonder consciousness
is still a mystery." (page 255)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Out of context, yes.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"There seems to be phenomenology. That’s a fact that the
heterophenomenologist enthusiastically concedes. But it does not
follow from this undeniable, universally attested fact that there
really is phenomenology." (page 366)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is time to recognize the idea of the possibility of zombies for
what it is: not a serious philosophical idea but a preposterous and
ignoble relic of ancient prejudices. Maybe women aren’t really
conscious! Maybe Jews! What pernicious nonsense." (page 405)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This protest is a little weird, given that earlier Dennett defines
"people" as "adult human beings" (not children?) and argues that
consciousness is largely a cultural phenomenon (so one culture could
be more conscious than another?).</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is hard to imagine how “just more of the same” could add up to
understanding, but we have very good reason to believe that it does,
so in this case, we should try harder, not give up." (page 439)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dennett implicitly rejects the possibility that there could be
something different, something not just more of the same, something
that is an explanation of consciousness rather than a rejection of a
dualist explanation.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"(What could a clam do with a secret? Just sit there in the mud,
chuckling to itself?)" (page 447)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is really funny to me somehow. What a happy clam!</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"the assumption that consciousness is a special all-or-nothing
property that sunders the universe into two vastly different
categories: the things that have it (the things that it is like
something to be, as Nagel would put it) and the things that lack
it." (page 447)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree that this is weird too.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"When a deaf-mute acquires language (in particular, Sign language,
the most natural language a deaf-mute can learn), a full-fledged
human mind is born, clearly different in discoverable ways from the
mind of a hearing person, but capable of all the reflective
intricacy and generative power—perhaps more."</p>
<p>"But without a natural language, a deaf-mute’s mind is terribly
stunted."</p>
<p>"Many people are afraid to see consciousness explained because they
fear that if we succeed in explaining it, we will lose our moral
bearings. Maybe we can imagine a conscious computer (or the
consciousness of a bat) but we shouldn’t try, they think. If we get
into that bad habit, we will start treating animals as if they were
wind-up toys, babies and deaf-mutes as if they were teddy bears,
and—just to add insult to injury—robots as if they were real
people."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(page 448)</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Do we think, for instance, that vast resources should be set aside
to preserve the imaginary prospects of a renewed mental life for
deeply comatose people, while there are no resources to spare to
enhance the desperate, but far from imaginary, expectations of the
poor? Myths about the sanctity of life, or of consciousness, cut
both ways. They may be useful in erecting barriers (against
euthanasia, against capital punishment, against abortion, against
eating meat) to impress the unimaginative, but at the price of
offensive hypocrisy or ridiculous self-deception among the more
enlightened." (page 454)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Leaving something out is not a feature of failed explanations, but
of successful explanations."</p>
<p>"Only a theory that explained conscious events in terms of
unconscious events could explain consciousness at all."</p>

<title>Heads, by Greg Bear</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>I read this because I heard it was about consciousness. It was only a
little bit about consciousness. Some quantum computers had some kind
of consciousness, but they were not central to anything. At the end
there was some possible additional consciousness stuff, but mostly
not. In the end, not nearly enough about consciousness. Three stars.</p>

<title>Sea of Tranquility, by Mandel</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_of_Tranquility_(novel)" title="Sea of Tranquility (novel)">Sea of Tranquility</a> is a lot of fun. There's a good deal of amusing
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autofiction">autofiction</a>, and fun mystery and sci-fi aspects. I have a fondness
for time travel. It's not very long, and it reads really quickly.</p>
<p>I agree with the author's take on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_hypothesis">simulation hypothesis</a>, which
is that it doesn't really matter. I think, therefore I am. I think
consciousness is a mysterious, special, and important part of this.</p>
<p>You can tell it's sci-fi because in the future there are airships.
There always have to be airships. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_St._John_Mandel" title="Emily St. John Mandel">Mandel</a>'s airships are not just
dirigibles though! They're fast enough for daily global commutes.
Exciting. More is not explained.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I think, as a species, we have a desire to believe that we’re
living at the climax of the story. It’s a kind of narcissism. We

the end of history, that now, after all these millennia of false
alarms, now is finally the worst that it’s ever been, that finally
we have reached the end of the world.”" (page 165)</p>
<p>"“My personal belief is that we turn to postapocalyptic fiction not
because we’re drawn to disaster, per se, but because we’re drawn to
what we imagine might come next. We long secretly for a world with
less technology in it.”" (page 167)</p>

<title>That little voice in your head, by Gawdat</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rob-archangel-50bb35176/" title="Rob Archangel">Rob Archangel</a> (of <a href="https://www.archangelink.com/" title="Your partner in leveraging your credibility and expertise into self-publishing success">Archangel Ink</a>) sent me <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mo_Gawdat" title="Mo Gawdat">Mo Gawdat</a>'s
latest <a href="https://www.mogawdat.com/littlevoice" title="That little voice in your head">book</a> to review, so I skimmed it. Gawdat's son died at 21.
The book is a collection of <a href="/20210107-enchiridion_in_52_sentences/" title="The Enchiridion in 52 sentences">stoic</a>, Buddhist, and TED Talk
philosophy. You could do worse, though I do think Gawdat is <a href="https://www.mogawdat.com/scarysmart" title="Scary Smart The Future of Artificial Intelligence and How You Can Save Our World">wrong</a>
about AI and consciousness. That Little Voice is uncomfortably like
watching him struggle to mourn.</p>
<p><img alt="cover" src="cover.jpg"></p>
<hr>
<p>To its credit, the book includes summaries.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Summary of Part One</p>
<p>4-3-2-1, those are the reasons our brains make us unhappy.</p>
<p><strong>4</strong> (wrong) <strong>Inputs</strong> distort our perception of the truth. Three
come from within us. Those are conditioning, recycled thoughts and
trapped emotions. But the biggest one is all-pervasive around us. It
is the hidden triggers, from the news media to the entertainment
industry, all the way to the advice of a friend that does not apply
to your life context. Don’t let your thoughts be influenced by your
inner inputs. See them for what they are and weed them out. Then,
whatever you do, stop injecting your life with hidden triggers. You
are what you think. Stop letting the thoughts of others make you who
you are.</p>
<p><strong>3</strong> (exaggerated) <strong>Defences</strong> keep us safe but make us suffer.
Our brains have built within them every defence mechanism that’s
helped other species. A reptilian brain that lives for avoiding
danger, a mammalian brain that exists to seek rewards and avoid
pain, and a rational brain that is constantly planning and
analysing. Those defences keep us stuck in Aversion, Attachment and
an All-Pervasive Dissatisfaction. Learn to make your reptile feel
safe, make your mammal enjoy what is and remind your rational human
to see that all is OK.</p>
<p><strong>2</strong> (opposite) <strong>Polarities</strong> are part of every one of us. The
feminine and the masculine. Those polarities are not determined by
biology, gender or sexual preference. They are a way of life. One is
about being and the other about doing. Our modern world, and each of
us, are submerged in doing. We need more of our feminine qualities.
We need to learn to be.</p>
<p><strong>1</strong> (harmful) <strong>Thought</strong> – the incessant type of thinking – is
the result of letting our thoughts repeat, unchecked by our
deliberate attention. Many clinical conditions that are associated
with unhappiness are the result of scattered thoughts and
mind-wandering. Learning to pay deliberate attention has always been
my top advice for anyone who seeks to be happy. Be here. Repeat a
bad habit often enough, and you become really good at it because,
through neuroplasticity, Practice Makes Miserable. Stop practising
your own unhappiness. Turn the process the opposite way. Learn to go
to the happiness gym and work on the habits that reverse the 4-3-2-1
model.</p>
<p>Practise limiting your information diet only to what’s good for you.
Remember to practise your gratitude muscle. Live more in the
feminine and pay deliberate attention. One small step after another
and your brain will be rewired for happiness to be its default
state.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Summary of Part Two</p>
<p>The impact of a thought is surely not confined within our skull and
surely not to the instant that thought took place. What you think
changes you emotionally and physically, and then it changes your
pattern of thinking itself as it plays endlessly on repeat.</p>
<p>Our emotions, erratic as they sometimes may seem, are
hyperpredictable. They are triggered by thoughts that follow
repeatable patterns. The modern world teaches us to hide our
emotions and this disconnects us from them, even to deny them.
Leaving our emotions unexpressed turns us into zombies walking
through life uninterested or pressure cookers waiting to explode.</p>
<p>But we only feel alive when we feel, just like we only feel when we
are alive. We need to get in touch with our emotions, acknowledge
them – even celebrate them – sit with them, experience their storms
and harness their energy to move us forward.</p>
<p>Our autonomic nervous system responds to the world even before our
thoughts catch up with what happened. Our sympathetic nervous system
stresses us to protect us. It prepares us to face challenges and
threats with superhuman powers. This feature in our design saved our
species, but now, as our stress response lingers, it is leading us
to unhappiness.</p>
<p>We need to engage our parasympathetic nervous system to remind our
bodies that things are OK. Learn to relax, be around those who do,
and create a sense of safety by remembering our blessings and
removing what stresses us from our lives.</p>
<p>Finally, we need to stop the endless loops of incessant thinking.
They take us down a spiral of unhappiness and leave no positive
impact on the world whatsoever. To stop the thinking, treat your
brain like a third party. I call mine Becky and I have a clear
agreement with my brain. Bring me joyful thoughts or useful
thoughts. Every other thought is a waste of my life. Sign the
contract. Get your brain to comply.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Summary of Part Three</p>
<p>Many happiness teachings may seem to come across as an invitation to
calm or control one’s brain. Because our stray incessant thoughts
can cause a lot of unhappiness, it is obvious that keeping our minds
in check is a sure path to a calmer, happier life. But it’s not the
only path.</p>
<p>If an active mind is engaged in useful thinking – generating
thoughts that improve your life and state of wellbeing – then, by
all means, think as much as you can.</p>
<p>There are four types of useful thoughts. I strongly urge you to make
those types of thoughts the norm of what your brain focuses on. That
way it will no longer have the capacity to think the negative
thoughts that waste your life and make you unhappy.</p>
<p>1) <strong>Experiential Thinking</strong> - Experiencing the world exactly as it
is requires your brain to engage just as much as it needs to when
processing any other kind of thought. As a matter of fact, because
your brain is only able to do one thing at a time, observing the
world with mindfulness is a bulletproof way to live in reality and
not inside your own head. Meditation is a valuable practice that
can, over time, reconfigure your brain to become more capable of
living in the present moment instead of lost in its own thoughts.</p>
<p>Meditation is just a practice, though. To truly transform those
skills into the reality of your everyday life, use newer versions of
it that are fit for the modern world to learn to be present every
minute of every day.</p>
<p>2) <strong>Problem-Solving</strong> – is the most highly praised type of thinking
in our analytical modern world. The capacity to overcome challenges
by finding solutions is mostly applied in our work and professional
life. Yet, it can equally be applied to lead to our happiness and
wellbeing.</p>
<p>The <strong>happiness flowchart</strong> is a good example of how you can use
your disciplined problem-solving brain to ensure you bounce back to
happiness swiftly when an event disturbs your mood. Once you’ve
learned to recognize, acknowledge, even embrace, an emotion, find
the thought that triggered it and then ask yourself three questions:</p>
<p>a. <strong>Is it true?</strong> Is there evidence to support the validity of the
thought triggering my happiness. If the thought is fiction created
by your brain, drop it. If it is true, then ask the next question...</p>
<p>b. <strong>Can I do something about it?</strong> Unhappiness, you see, is just a
survival mechanism. It’s your brain’s invitation for you to do
something about what it sees as a suboptimal condition for your
survival and success. If there is something you can do about what’s
making you unhappy, do it. The unhappiness will go away and your
world will become better. If there is nothing you can do, then ask
the last question ...</p>
<p>c. <strong>Can I accept and commit?</strong> Life, every now and again, is bound
to send a predicament your way. An event that doesn’t meet your
hopes of how life should be which is beyond your ability to fix or
improve. When there is nothing you can do about your situation,
learn to accept it for what it is, then commit to do whatever you
can do to make your life better despite, or even because of, the
challenge that you are facing.</p>
<p>3) <strong>Flow</strong> – When we flow, we merge our being with our doing. We
get absorbed into what we do fully, we do it better and we feel
lighter. To flow, make the task at hand a tiny bit harder than your
current skill, clear away the distractions and break it into smaller
tasks and focus on the small bits instead of the final results, do
each bit to the best of your abilities and forget about time. Give
every task all the time it needs.</p>
<p>4) <strong>Give</strong> – It is the smartest thing you can ever do. Nothing will
ever make you happier or make our world better.</p>
<p>Our brains are nothing but sophisticated computer systems. They are
highly predictable in their operations. You don’t necessarily need a
silent brain to be happy. All you need is a positive, useful brain.

<p>“It will be helpful to you if you always assume your categories are
misleading.” (Hans Rosling, Factfulness, page 158)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A while ago this kind of data was used to claim that “truck driver”
was the most common job in the US. That was <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/no-truck-driver-isnt-the-most-common-job-in-your-state-2015-02-12" title="Opinion: No, ‘truck driver’ isn’t the most common job in your state">debunked</a>, but even the
debunking didn't do a great job of showing the impact of how we group
jobs together. The hierarchical view (using the census occupation code
<a href="https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/demo/guidance/industry-occupation/2018-occupation-code-list-and-crosswalk.xlsx" title="2018 Census Occupation Code List">list</a>) is somewhat helpful in this respect, I think.</p>
<p>While “Driver/Sales Workers And Truck Drivers” at 1.74% is the largest
non-“other”-titled category, you can see that there are significantly
more people working at K-12 schools, for example, across various
subcategories of teachers.</p>

<title>The Ministry for the Future, by Robinson</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>576 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ministry_for_the_Future" title="The Ministry for the Future">pages</a> in 106 chapters. One from POV of the market. Another: a
photon. Writing often in this style. One chapter a list of NGOs by
country. Repeated references to Zürich's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganymed_%28Z%C3%BCrich%29" title="Ganymed (Zürich)">statue</a> of Ganymede.
Eco-fantasy from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Stanley_Robinson" title="Kim Stanley Robinson">lover</a> of Antarctica. Largely okay with
terrorism.</p>
<p><img alt="cover" src="cover.jpg"></p>
<hr>
<p>Here are some of the core predictions and my thoughts on them:</p>
<ul>
<li>The rich will start caring about poor people affected by climate
   disasters.<ul>
<li>In the book a heatwave kills 20 million people in India,
   jump-starting a lot of action. Certainly people would take
   note, but I'm not sure even this kind of disaster would
   catalyze global empathy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Eco-terrorism will lead to lots of good changes to behavior and
   policy.<ul>
<li>People deliberately give cows mad cow disease, so people stop
   eating meat. Lots of planes are crashed by swarms of drones, so
   people stop flying. I think it's unlikely the crimes would be
   committed, and I think if they were it's still unlikely the
   changes would result.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Agriculture will all switch to organic and it will go great.<ul>
<li>The author references <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikkim" title="Sikkim">Sikkim</a> as an organic success story.
   More recently, it's hard not to think of the failure in
   <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/03/05/sri-lanka-organic-farming-crisis/" title="In Sri Lanka, Organic Farming Went Catastrophically Wrong">Sri Lanka</a>. I don't think the world wants to have
   agriculture be more labor-intensive and less productive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Everyone will switch to one privacy-first internet service.<ul>
<li>In the book it's called "YourLock" and it isn't clear how it
   works. Quantum encryption doesn't make this suddenly something
   people will want to use.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Blockchain-based "carbon coin" will encourage carbon sequestration.<ul>
<li>The book has all fiat currency becoming blockchain-based, and
   also central banks issue these "carbon coins" with guarantees
   on their value increasing over time. The author is really
   jazzed about this but I don't know why it's that much better
   than direct compensation in fiat currency, for example.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Modern Monetary Theory is right: You can print money without
   causing inflation.<ul>
<li>This probably seemed realistic in 2020. In 2022, it seems
   suspect.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We're going post-capitalism.<ul>
<li>The author isn't super clear, in places favoring central
   planning that works (because of AI?) and elsewhere holding up
   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondragon_Corporation" title="Mondragon Corporation">Mondragón</a> and unions as exemplars.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Guaranteed jobs for all!<ul>
<li>Is a guaranteed job different from Universal Basic Income?
   (What prevents me from not turning up and just collecting the
   pay? If you can be fired is it a guaranteed job?)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>10x max ratio from lowest to highest income.<ul>
<li>Hmm! Would this be cool?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Global refugee passports<ul>
<li>This seems nice!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Airships<ul>
<li>At least this is sort of a plausible story for why we would use
   airships (to avoid burning carbon). Better story than
   steam-punk.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As a novel, it's not great. As a collection of ideas to think about,
it does introduce a few, but it's not very convincing. It does prompt
some thought. What's really going to happen?</p>
<p>A few quotes follow.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"For a while, therefore, it looked like the great heat wave would be
like mass shootings in the United States—mourned by all, deplored by
all, and then immediately forgotten or superseded by the next one,
until they came in a daily drumbeat and became the new normal."
(page 25)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Ideology, n. An imaginary relationship to a real situation. In
common usage, what the other person has, especially when
systematically distorting the facts. But it seems to us that an
ideology is a necessary feature of cognition, and if anyone were to
lack one, which we doubt, they would be badly disabled. There is a
real situation, that can’t be denied, but it is too big for any
individual to know in full, and so we must create our understanding
by way of an act of the imagination. So we all have an ideology, and
this is a good thing. So much information pours into the mind,
ranging from sensory experience to discursive and mediated inputs of
all kinds, that some kind of personal organizing system is necessary
to make sense of things in ways that allow one to decide and to act.
Worldview, philosophy, religion, these are all synonyms for ideology
as defined above; and so is science, although it’s the different
one, the special one, by way of its perpetual cross-checking with
reality tests of all kinds, and its continuous sharpening of focus.
That surely makes science central to a most interesting project,
which is to invent, improve, and put to use an ideology that
explains in a coherent and useful way as much of the blooming
buzzing inrush of the world as possible. What one would hope for in
an ideology is clarity and explanatory breadth, and power. We leave
the proof of this as an exercise for the reader." (page 42)</p>

<p>"The Götterdämmerung Syndrome, as with most violent pathologies, is
more often seen in men than women. It is often interpreted as an
example of narcissistic rage. Those who feel it are usually
privileged and entitled, and they become extremely angry when their
privileges and sense of entitlement are being taken away. If then
their choice gets reduced to admitting they are in error or
destroying the world, a reduction they often feel to be the case,
the obvious choice for them is to destroy the world; for they cannot
admit they have ever erred." (page 298)</p>

<p>"Setting a generous definition of a universal necessary income,
guaranteeing jobs to all, and capping personal annual income at ten
times that minimum amount, as they had done in many countries, had
immediately crushed Gini figures down. The EU had led the way, the
US and China had followed, and then everywhere else had begun to
leak their most educated young people to these flatter countries,
until the countries losing educated people also instituted it.
Guaranteed jobs, yes, but also universal basic services, and
supported social reproduction, along with infrastructure and housing
construction projects, had completed the rise out of poverty at the
low end of the world income scale." (page 478)</p>
