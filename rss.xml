<title>That little voice in your head, by Gawdat</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rob-archangel-50bb35176/" title="Rob Archangel">Rob Archangel</a> (of <a href="https://www.archangelink.com/" title="Your partner in leveraging your credibility and expertise into self-publishing success">Archangel Ink</a>) sent me <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mo_Gawdat" title="Mo Gawdat">Mo Gawdat</a>'s
latest <a href="https://www.mogawdat.com/littlevoice" title="That little voice in your head">book</a> to review, so I skimmed it. Gawdat's son died at 21.
The book is a collection of <a href="/20210107-enchiridion_in_52_sentences/" title="The Enchiridion in 52 sentences">stoic</a>, Buddhist, and TED Talk
philosophy. You could do worse, though I do think Gawdat is <a href="https://www.mogawdat.com/scarysmart" title="Scary Smart The Future of Artificial Intelligence and How You Can Save Our World">wrong</a>
about AI and consciousness. That Little Voice is uncomfortably like
watching him struggle to mourn.</p>
<p><img alt="cover" src="cover.jpg"></p>
<hr>
<p>To its credit, the book includes summaries.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Summary of Part One</p>
<p>4-3-2-1, those are the reasons our brains make us unhappy.</p>
<p><strong>4</strong> (wrong) <strong>Inputs</strong> distort our perception of the truth. Three
come from within us. Those are conditioning, recycled thoughts and
trapped emotions. But the biggest one is all-pervasive around us. It
is the hidden triggers, from the news media to the entertainment
industry, all the way to the advice of a friend that does not apply
to your life context. Don’t let your thoughts be influenced by your
inner inputs. See them for what they are and weed them out. Then,
whatever you do, stop injecting your life with hidden triggers. You
are what you think. Stop letting the thoughts of others make you who
you are.</p>
<p><strong>3</strong> (exaggerated) <strong>Defences</strong> keep us safe but make us suffer.
Our brains have built within them every defence mechanism that’s
helped other species. A reptilian brain that lives for avoiding
danger, a mammalian brain that exists to seek rewards and avoid
pain, and a rational brain that is constantly planning and
analysing. Those defences keep us stuck in Aversion, Attachment and
an All-Pervasive Dissatisfaction. Learn to make your reptile feel
safe, make your mammal enjoy what is and remind your rational human
to see that all is OK.</p>
<p><strong>2</strong> (opposite) <strong>Polarities</strong> are part of every one of us. The
feminine and the masculine. Those polarities are not determined by
biology, gender or sexual preference. They are a way of life. One is
about being and the other about doing. Our modern world, and each of
us, are submerged in doing. We need more of our feminine qualities.
We need to learn to be.</p>
<p><strong>1</strong> (harmful) <strong>Thought</strong> – the incessant type of thinking – is
the result of letting our thoughts repeat, unchecked by our
deliberate attention. Many clinical conditions that are associated
with unhappiness are the result of scattered thoughts and
mind-wandering. Learning to pay deliberate attention has always been
my top advice for anyone who seeks to be happy. Be here. Repeat a
bad habit often enough, and you become really good at it because,
through neuroplasticity, Practice Makes Miserable. Stop practising
your own unhappiness. Turn the process the opposite way. Learn to go
to the happiness gym and work on the habits that reverse the 4-3-2-1
model.</p>
<p>Practise limiting your information diet only to what’s good for you.
Remember to practise your gratitude muscle. Live more in the
feminine and pay deliberate attention. One small step after another
and your brain will be rewired for happiness to be its default
state.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Summary of Part Two</p>
<p>The impact of a thought is surely not confined within our skull and
surely not to the instant that thought took place. What you think
changes you emotionally and physically, and then it changes your
pattern of thinking itself as it plays endlessly on repeat.</p>
<p>Our emotions, erratic as they sometimes may seem, are
hyperpredictable. They are triggered by thoughts that follow
repeatable patterns. The modern world teaches us to hide our
emotions and this disconnects us from them, even to deny them.
Leaving our emotions unexpressed turns us into zombies walking
through life uninterested or pressure cookers waiting to explode.</p>
<p>But we only feel alive when we feel, just like we only feel when we
are alive. We need to get in touch with our emotions, acknowledge
them – even celebrate them – sit with them, experience their storms
and harness their energy to move us forward.</p>
<p>Our autonomic nervous system responds to the world even before our
thoughts catch up with what happened. Our sympathetic nervous system
stresses us to protect us. It prepares us to face challenges and
threats with superhuman powers. This feature in our design saved our
species, but now, as our stress response lingers, it is leading us
to unhappiness.</p>
<p>We need to engage our parasympathetic nervous system to remind our
bodies that things are OK. Learn to relax, be around those who do,
and create a sense of safety by remembering our blessings and
removing what stresses us from our lives.</p>
<p>Finally, we need to stop the endless loops of incessant thinking.
They take us down a spiral of unhappiness and leave no positive
impact on the world whatsoever. To stop the thinking, treat your
brain like a third party. I call mine Becky and I have a clear
agreement with my brain. Bring me joyful thoughts or useful
thoughts. Every other thought is a waste of my life. Sign the
contract. Get your brain to comply.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Summary of Part Three</p>
<p>Many happiness teachings may seem to come across as an invitation to
calm or control one’s brain. Because our stray incessant thoughts
can cause a lot of unhappiness, it is obvious that keeping our minds
in check is a sure path to a calmer, happier life. But it’s not the
only path.</p>
<p>If an active mind is engaged in useful thinking – generating
thoughts that improve your life and state of wellbeing – then, by
all means, think as much as you can.</p>
<p>There are four types of useful thoughts. I strongly urge you to make
those types of thoughts the norm of what your brain focuses on. That
way it will no longer have the capacity to think the negative
thoughts that waste your life and make you unhappy.</p>
<p>1) <strong>Experiential Thinking</strong> - Experiencing the world exactly as it
is requires your brain to engage just as much as it needs to when
processing any other kind of thought. As a matter of fact, because
your brain is only able to do one thing at a time, observing the
world with mindfulness is a bulletproof way to live in reality and
not inside your own head. Meditation is a valuable practice that
can, over time, reconfigure your brain to become more capable of
living in the present moment instead of lost in its own thoughts.</p>
<p>Meditation is just a practice, though. To truly transform those
skills into the reality of your everyday life, use newer versions of
it that are fit for the modern world to learn to be present every
minute of every day.</p>
<p>2) <strong>Problem-Solving</strong> – is the most highly praised type of thinking
in our analytical modern world. The capacity to overcome challenges
by finding solutions is mostly applied in our work and professional
life. Yet, it can equally be applied to lead to our happiness and
wellbeing.</p>
<p>The <strong>happiness flowchart</strong> is a good example of how you can use
your disciplined problem-solving brain to ensure you bounce back to
happiness swiftly when an event disturbs your mood. Once you’ve
learned to recognize, acknowledge, even embrace, an emotion, find
the thought that triggered it and then ask yourself three questions:</p>
<p>a. <strong>Is it true?</strong> Is there evidence to support the validity of the
thought triggering my happiness. If the thought is fiction created
by your brain, drop it. If it is true, then ask the next question...</p>
<p>b. <strong>Can I do something about it?</strong> Unhappiness, you see, is just a
survival mechanism. It’s your brain’s invitation for you to do
something about what it sees as a suboptimal condition for your
survival and success. If there is something you can do about what’s
making you unhappy, do it. The unhappiness will go away and your
world will become better. If there is nothing you can do, then ask
the last question ...</p>
<p>c. <strong>Can I accept and commit?</strong> Life, every now and again, is bound
to send a predicament your way. An event that doesn’t meet your
hopes of how life should be which is beyond your ability to fix or
improve. When there is nothing you can do about your situation,
learn to accept it for what it is, then commit to do whatever you
can do to make your life better despite, or even because of, the
challenge that you are facing.</p>
<p>3) <strong>Flow</strong> – When we flow, we merge our being with our doing. We
get absorbed into what we do fully, we do it better and we feel
lighter. To flow, make the task at hand a tiny bit harder than your
current skill, clear away the distractions and break it into smaller
tasks and focus on the small bits instead of the final results, do
each bit to the best of your abilities and forget about time. Give
every task all the time it needs.</p>
<p>4) <strong>Give</strong> – It is the smartest thing you can ever do. Nothing will
ever make you happier or make our world better.</p>
<p>Our brains are nothing but sophisticated computer systems. They are
highly predictable in their operations. You don’t necessarily need a
silent brain to be happy. All you need is a positive, useful brain.
Your brain will do what you tell it to do. It’s time to start your
training.</p>

<p>“It will be helpful to you if you always assume your categories are
misleading.” (Hans Rosling, Factfulness, page 158)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A while ago this kind of data was used to claim that “truck driver”
was the most common job in the US. That was <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/no-truck-driver-isnt-the-most-common-job-in-your-state-2015-02-12" title="Opinion: No, ‘truck driver’ isn’t the most common job in your state">debunked</a>, but even the
debunking didn't do a great job of showing the impact of how we group
jobs together. The hierarchical view (using the census occupation code
<a href="https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/demo/guidance/industry-occupation/2018-occupation-code-list-and-crosswalk.xlsx" title="2018 Census Occupation Code List">list</a>) is somewhat helpful in this respect, I think.</p>
<p>While “Driver/Sales Workers And Truck Drivers” at 1.74% is the largest
non-“other”-titled category, you can see that there are significantly
more people working at K-12 schools, for example, across various
subcategories of teachers.</p>

<title>The Ministry for the Future, by Robinson</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>576 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ministry_for_the_Future" title="The Ministry for the Future">pages</a> in 106 chapters. One from POV of the market. Another: a
photon. Writing often in this style. One chapter a list of NGOs by
country. Repeated references to Zürich's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganymed_%28Z%C3%BCrich%29" title="Ganymed (Zürich)">statue</a> of Ganymede.
Eco-fantasy from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Stanley_Robinson" title="Kim Stanley Robinson">lover</a> of Antarctica. Largely okay with
terrorism.</p>
<p><img alt="cover" src="cover.jpg"></p>
<hr>
<p>Here are some of the core predictions and my thoughts on them:</p>
<ul>
<li>The rich will start caring about poor people affected by climate
   disasters.<ul>
<li>In the book a heatwave kills 20 million people in India,
   jump-starting a lot of action. Certainly people would take
   note, but I'm not sure even this kind of disaster would
   catalyze global empathy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Eco-terrorism will lead to lots of good changes to behavior and
   policy.<ul>
<li>People deliberately give cows mad cow disease, so people stop
   eating meat. Lots of planes are crashed by swarms of drones, so
   people stop flying. I think it's unlikely the crimes would be
   committed, and I think if they were it's still unlikely the
   changes would result.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Agriculture will all switch to organic and it will go great.<ul>
<li>The author references <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikkim" title="Sikkim">Sikkim</a> as an organic success story.
   More recently, it's hard not to think of the failure in
   <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/03/05/sri-lanka-organic-farming-crisis/" title="In Sri Lanka, Organic Farming Went Catastrophically Wrong">Sri Lanka</a>. I don't think the world wants to have
   agriculture be more labor-intensive and less productive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Everyone will switch to one privacy-first internet service.<ul>
<li>In the book it's called "YourLock" and it isn't clear how it
   works. Quantum encryption doesn't make this suddenly something
   people will want to use.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Blockchain-based "carbon coin" will encourage carbon sequestration.<ul>
<li>The book has all fiat currency becoming blockchain-based, and
   also central banks issue these "carbon coins" with guarantees
   on their value increasing over time. The author is really
   jazzed about this but I don't know why it's that much better
   than direct compensation in fiat currency, for example.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Modern Monetary Theory is right: You can print money without
   causing inflation.<ul>
<li>This probably seemed realistic in 2020. In 2022, it seems
   suspect.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We're going post-capitalism.<ul>
<li>The author isn't super clear, in places favoring central
   planning that works (because of AI?) and elsewhere holding up
   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondragon_Corporation" title="Mondragon Corporation">Mondragón</a> and unions as exemplars.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Guaranteed jobs for all!<ul>
<li>Is a guaranteed job different from Universal Basic Income?
   (What prevents me from not turning up and just collecting the
   pay? If you can be fired is it a guaranteed job?)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>10x max ratio from lowest to highest income.<ul>
<li>Hmm! Would this be cool?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Global refugee passports<ul>
<li>This seems nice!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Airships<ul>
<li>At least this is sort of a plausible story for why we would use
   airships (to avoid burning carbon). Better story than
   steam-punk.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As a novel, it's not great. As a collection of ideas to think about,
it does introduce a few, but it's not very convincing. It does prompt
some thought. What's really going to happen?</p>
<p>A few quotes follow.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"For a while, therefore, it looked like the great heat wave would be
like mass shootings in the United States—mourned by all, deplored by
all, and then immediately forgotten or superseded by the next one,
until they came in a daily drumbeat and became the new normal."
(page 25)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Ideology, n. An imaginary relationship to a real situation. In
common usage, what the other person has, especially when
systematically distorting the facts. But it seems to us that an
ideology is a necessary feature of cognition, and if anyone were to
lack one, which we doubt, they would be badly disabled. There is a
real situation, that can’t be denied, but it is too big for any
individual to know in full, and so we must create our understanding
by way of an act of the imagination. So we all have an ideology, and
this is a good thing. So much information pours into the mind,
ranging from sensory experience to discursive and mediated inputs of
all kinds, that some kind of personal organizing system is necessary
to make sense of things in ways that allow one to decide and to act.
Worldview, philosophy, religion, these are all synonyms for ideology
as defined above; and so is science, although it’s the different
one, the special one, by way of its perpetual cross-checking with
reality tests of all kinds, and its continuous sharpening of focus.
That surely makes science central to a most interesting project,
which is to invent, improve, and put to use an ideology that
explains in a coherent and useful way as much of the blooming
buzzing inrush of the world as possible. What one would hope for in
an ideology is clarity and explanatory breadth, and power. We leave
the proof of this as an exercise for the reader." (page 42)</p>

<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"And yet even primitive math still takes mathematicians, the rest of
us being so clueless." (page 60)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"One-eight-billionth wasn’t a very big fraction, but then again
there were poisons that worked in the parts-per-billion range, so it
wasn’t entirely unprecedented for such a small agent to change
things." (page 65)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Indian agriculture moving into its post–green revolution is also a
giant step toward independent subtropical knowledge production,
achieved in collaboration with Indonesian and African and South
American permaculturists, and its importance going forward cannot be
over-emphasized." (page 126)</p>

<p>"The Götterdämmerung Syndrome, as with most violent pathologies, is
more often seen in men than women. It is often interpreted as an

privileged and entitled, and they become extremely angry when their
privileges and sense of entitlement are being taken away. If then
their choice gets reduced to admitting they are in error or
destroying the world, a reduction they often feel to be the case,
the obvious choice for them is to destroy the world; for they cannot
admit they have ever erred." (page 298)</p>

<p>"Setting a generous definition of a universal necessary income,
guaranteeing jobs to all, and capping personal annual income at ten
times that minimum amount, as they had done in many countries, had
immediately crushed Gini figures down. The EU had led the way, the
US and China had followed, and then everywhere else had begun to
leak their most educated young people to these flatter countries,
until the countries losing educated people also instituted it.
Guaranteed jobs, yes, but also universal basic services, and
supported social reproduction, along with infrastructure and housing
construction projects, had completed the rise out of poverty at the
low end of the world income scale." (page 478)</p>

<title>Nielsen's Quantum Country</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>You can understand the force of gravity as proportional to one over
distance squared without understanding why that should be, and this is
the manner in which Nielsen explains quantum mechanics in his
<a href="https://quantum.country/" title="Quantum Country">series of essays</a>—and with considerable clarity.</p>
<p><img alt="summary" src="summary.jpg"></p>
<p>I knew <a href="https://michaelnielsen.org/" title="Michael Nielsen">Nielsen</a> first from his book
<a href="http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/" title="Neural Networks and Deep Learning">Neural Networks and Deep Learning</a>. I hadn't realized he was a
quantum physicist first! His popular <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Computation-Information-10th-Anniversary/dp/1107002176" title="Quantum Computation and Quantum Information">textbook</a> with Chuang was
published in 2001, and his YouTube series
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1826E60FD05B44E4" title="Quantum computing for the determined">Quantum computing for the determined</a> came out in 2010. So the 2019
<a href="https://quantum.country/" title="Quantum Country">Quantum Country</a> was a return to the topic.</p>
<p><a href="https://andymatuschak.org/" title="Andy Matuschak">Matuschak</a> is a co-author on the project, and my guess is he built
the “mnemonic medium” it uses. There are flashcards. The
implementation relies on an account mechanism that doesn't work very
well. I love spaced repetition (<a href="/20201009-anki_is_easy/" title="Anki is easy">1</a>, <a href="/20210908-spaced_repetition_is_o_log_n_sustainable/" title="Spaced repetition is O(log n) sustainable">2</a>) but I think the strength
of the project is Nielsen's exposition.</p>
<p>A few takeaways in addition to the summary image above:</p>
<ul>
<li>Entanglement is key: Probabilities are not independent, which is
   how you get the exponential capability of quantum computing with
   more qubits. (See nutshell #4.)<ul>
<li>The usual entangled pair is just one where all the probability
   is on 00 and 11, with none on 01 or 10.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Quantum search gives \( O(\sqrt{n}) \) general performance.
   (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm" title="Shor's algorithm">Shor's factoring</a> is faster but not much covered in the text.)</li>
<li>Quantum teleportation does <em>not</em> move information faster than the
   speed of light, because you have to send classical information as
   part of the procedure.</li>
</ul>
<p>A few explicitly unresolved issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do we feel, after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell%27s_theorem" title="Bell's theorem">Bell inequality</a> results, about not having
   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_locality#Quantum_mechanics">local realism</a>? (I would rather give up locality, I guess, but
   Nielsen suggests giving up realism. Trippy.)</li>
<li>The interpretation problem: What does a quantum state even mean?</li>
<li>The measurement problem: What does it even mean to measure a
   system?</li>
</ul>
<p>The whole thing is great. Fun with linear algebra! Check it out!</p>

<title>The Ride of a Lifetime, by Iger</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Iger" title="Bob Iger">Bob</a> starts chapter one with “This book is not a memoir,” so you
know from the start you're dealing with an unreliable narrator.
Compared to Catmull in <a href="/20220213-creativity_inc_by_catmull/" title="Creativity, Inc., by Catmull">Creativity, Inc.</a>, Iger does seem more
direct, and his experiences are interesting, but I like Iger less, I
think.</p>
<p><img alt="cover" src="cover.jpg"></p>
<hr>
<p>Here are Iger's ten principles from the prologue:</p>
<ol>
<li>Optimism</li>
<li>Courage</li>
<li>Focus</li>
<li>Decisiveness</li>
<li>Curiosity</li>
<li>Fairness</li>
<li>Thoughtfulness</li>
<li>Authenticity</li>
<li>The Relentless Pursuit of Perfection</li>
<li>Integrity</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>On page 9, you get a story of how some coworker exposed himself to
Iger.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"As for all the glamour, there is (and eventually there was) a
convincing argument to be made that living that high off the hog was
irresponsible." (page 14)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wonder if the old TV business is analogous to the current tech
scene...</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"I’ve found that often people will focus on little details as a way
of masking a lack of any clear, coherent, big thoughts." (page 43)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is legit.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"I wouldn’t as a rule recommend promoting someone as rapidly as they
promoted me," (page 49)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>haha~</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"I wanted the merger to go well, and I wanted to make sure the
Capital Cities team was treated well by Disney. Without me there, I
was fairly certain they would get subsumed by Disney in potentially
dispiriting ways." (page 53)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This guy, huh?</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Managing your own time and respecting others’ time is one of the
most vital things to do as a manager," (page 63)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Concur.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"these are the people to nurture—not the ones who are clamoring for
promotions and complaining about not being utilized enough but the
ones who are proving themselves to be indispensable day in and day
out." (page 66)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Concur.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"He wanted the “albino Mickeys,” as he called them, taken from the
shelves, which we didn’t do, but it was a huge distraction." (page
87)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Crazy micro-managing board member...</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"I’ve always prided myself on my ability and willingness to put in a
greater effort than anyone else." (page 104)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This guy, huh? He elsewhere makes a point of how he didn't take a
two-week vacation until late in his career.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"I could control what I did and how I comported myself. Everything
else was beyond my control." (page 109)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See also: <a href="/20210107-enchiridion_in_52_sentences/" title="The Enchiridion in 52 sentences">The Enchiridion</a></p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"pushing strategic responsibility back to the businesses sooner
rather than later. I hoped that if we could reduce the grip that
Strat Planning had over all of our divisions, we would slowly begin
to restore the company’s morale." (page 116)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is one of the more interesting things he actually did, moving
toward more decentralization. Seems good.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"We landed on Twitter." (page 190)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I didn't realize Disney had been close to acquiring Twitter!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Twitter was a potentially powerful platform for us, but I couldn’t
get past the challenges that would come with it. The challenges and
controversies were almost too much to list, but they included how to
manage hate speech, and making fraught decisions regarding freedom
of speech, what to do about fake accounts algorithmically spewing
out political “messaging” to influence elections, and the general
rage and lack of civility that was sometimes evident on the
platform. Those would become our problems. They were so unlike any
we’d encountered, and I felt they would be corrosive to the Disney
brand. On the Sunday after the board had just given me the go-ahead
to pursue the acquisition of Twitter, I sent a note to all of the
members telling them I had “cold feet,” and explaining my reasoning
for withdrawing. Then I called Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s CEO, who was
also a member of the Disney board. Jack was stunned, but very
polite. I wished Jack luck, and I hung up feeling relieved." (page
190)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"I would decide at the end of each year how much stock would vest,
and that it was going to be based not on revenue but on how well
they were able to work together. “I don’t want any politics,” I
said. “This is too important. It’s for the good of the company, and
it’s good for you. I need you to step up.”" (page 196)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is interesting too; kind of the reverse of decentralization, but
I like how it gets away from purely quantified compensation.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"My new retirement date is December 2021," (page 221)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Iger" title="Bob Iger">Bob</a>'s Wikipedia page makes it seem like this was not the initial
plan, but here it seems like it was?</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Esther Newberg, for your guidance and for talking me into writing
this book. You said it was going to be easy and you sure were
wrong!" (page 236)</p>

<title>Mastering Python, by van Hattem</title>

<title>Before the Coffee Gets Cold, by Kawaguchi</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>It's a cute short <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_the_Coffee_Gets_Cold">book</a>. It reads very clearly as a novelization of
a one-set play. It's about interpersonal relationships and making
tough choices even when you have incorrect information. In the end,
the real time travel was inside us all along.</p>

<p>I read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beginning_of_Infinity" title="The Beginning of Infinity">this book</a> years ago (2017 or earlier) and didn't write it
up at the time, but some of the themes keep coming up.
<a href="/20170825-characteristics_of_good_theories/" title="Characteristics of good theories">Characteristics of good theories</a>, for one thing. But more so the
fundamental optimism that we can keep going indefinitely. Deutsch is
focused on knowledge, understanding, and explanations—but perhaps also
for prosperity, as in a post-scarcity "Star Trek" future (<a href="/20210401-trekonomics_by_saadia/" title="Trekonomics, by Saadia">Saadia</a>,
<a href="/20201109-economics_of_star_trek_by_webb/" title="The Economics of Star Trek, by Webb">Webb</a>). Deutsch's thoughts on quantum theory are fun, but the
optimistic worldview may be more valuable.</p>

<title>The Myth of the Rational Voter, by Caplan</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>Did anyone ever seriously believe voters were rational? Well,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Caplan">Caplan</a> has a 2007 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Myth_of_the_Rational_Voter">book</a>, and of course the conclusion is that
we should be more libertarian. "Rational" means in agreement with
economists (meaning Caplan), and by page 197 he advocates "a test of
voter competence." As usual, it's not all wrong, but I'm not sure it's
all right.</p>
<p><img alt="cover" src="cover.jpg"></p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"[T]he superstitions to be feared in the present day are much less
religious than political; and of all the forms of idolotry I know
none more irrational and ignoble than this blind worship of mere
numbers." (epigraph)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"You should not blame the prescription simply because the patient
refuses to take his medicine. <em>The Myth of the Rational Voter</em>
contains many workable reforms, but due to voter irrationality they
are unlikely to be tried." (ix)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At some point, it is part of the task of solving problems to create
solutions that work in practice, not only in a hypothetical world
imagined by the solver.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Once economists admit to themselves that voters are just like their
students, only worse, they will be poised to unravel the mysteries
of politics and policy." (xi)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"The paradox of democracy ... In theory, democracy is a bulwark
against socially harmful policies, but in practice it gives them a
safe harbor." (page 1)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Economists and cognitive psychologists usually presume that
everyone "processes information" to the best of his ability." (page
2)</p>
<p>"The main difference between the two disciplines is that cognitive
psychologists are much more likely than economists to conclude that
people's best information processing is not very good." (page 211,
note to preceeding)</p>

<p>"This book has three conjoined themes. The first: Doubts about the
rationality of voters are empirically justified. The second: Voter
irrationality is precisely what economic theory implies once we
adopt introspectively plausible assumptions about human motivation.
The third: Voter irrationality is the key to a realistic picture of
democracy." (page 3)</p>

<title>Red Roulette, by Shum</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>The success of this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Roulette">book</a> is that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desmond_Shum">Shum</a> straddles sympathetic
and repulsive. He is deeply flawed and yet less flawed than the China
he describes. He is an unreliable narrator but perhaps among the most
reliable available. His viewpoint is part of the view.</p>

<title>Seven Games, by Roeder</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p><a href="https://oroeder.github.io/">Roeder</a> writes about checkers, chess, go, backgammon, poker,
scrabble, and bridge. He gets philosophical, on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_Ludens">Homo ludens</a> and
what AI is and so on. It's interesting and I learned about some game
variations that are fun to try. Quality pandemic book.</p>
<p><img alt="cover" src="cover.jpg"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I’m a machine and you’re a machine and we both think, don’t we?"

think)</p>

central to our developmental intelligence." (page 12)</p>

<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Ken Thompson, the designer of the Unix operating system and a chess
machine called Belle, once spent an hour a day for three years
keying in lines from the Encyclopedia of Chess Openings." (page 35)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Shannon’s paper described two strategies for programming a computer
to play chess. Type A programs employed brute-force search and
evaluation, analyzing every possible move, and all possible
subsequent moves, no matter how unpromising they might look to a
human observer. In other words, they exploited the computer’s chief
strength: sheer calculation. Shannon, however, thought such a player
would be “both slow and weak.” Type B programs were more selective,
examining only certain small yet promising branches on chess’s
enormous tree. In other words, they exploited something like human
intuition. Early computer scientists thought the successful players
would be Type B, but with the rapid expansion of computing power,
computer scientists were lured into pursuing Type A." (page 69)</p>

<p>"The key to elite chess is preparation, which Stockfish
facilitates." (page 84)</p>

sitting idle." (page 105)</p>

during my research, that one never tires of." (page 153)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"In the end, of course, it was futile. Tesauro, whose research
inspired XG, expressed a similar sentiment about human players in
light of essentially perfect AI. “They play tournaments and they
study very hard,” he said. “I just don’t see the point.”" (page 160)</p>

<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Chance, in other words, is a fertile garden in which human ego and
delusion flourish." (page 162)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Before bots, everybody believed that they were the best player. The
type of people we have now are people who like to study, who enjoy
the process of improving their own game." (pages 163-164)</p>

used to train its AI players, is not winning but learning." (page

<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Moreover, these languages must be common knowledge. You and your
partner must reveal your dialect’s structure and intricacies to your
opponents, and players are allowed to ask questions of their
opponents like “What did that bid mean?” Bridge is a game of
communication but not of subterfuge. As such, the “gravest possible
offense” in bridge, according to its official rules, is exchanging
information with one’s partner outside of what the rules allow—that
is, outside of the formal and public bidding process. Illicit
language is the cardinal sin of the game." (page 247)</p>

order that underlies the universe.”" (page 267, quoting Matt
Ginsberg)</p>

<p>"Marx and Nietzsche, Hurka points out, believed that “a central
human good was activity that on the one side is necessarily directed

<p>"“You have this AI built to do this thing really well,” he added,
“but it doesn’t have any particular experience of it. ... I’m a rock
climber, and AI being able to beat me at Go matters as much as a
helicopter being able to beat me at a rock climb.”" (page 277,
quoting C. Thi Nguyen)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Modern AI systems require gobs of data to train, which makes easily
collectible and cheap data attractive. These easy, quantified
metrics can stand in for success in fields whose aims are in reality
complicated and subtle: clicks for journalism, steps for exercise,
box office for cinema, auction prices for paintings. Nguyen calls
this “value collapse”—when rich, subtle values are replaced by
simplified, quantified versions of those values." (page 278)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Games became solace. We players did not arrive in droves seeking
difficulty or complexity, or a sense of achievement, or a frivolous
distraction. We arrived, I believe, in search of agency that had
been temporarily denied by sensible public health measures." (page

<title>Elder Race, by Tchaikovsky</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>As mentioned in its dedication, Tchaikovsky's 2021 short novel
<a href="https://publishing.tor.com/elderrace-adriantchaikovsky/9781250768711/">Elder Race</a> is heavily inspired by Wolfe's 1967 story
<a href="https://www.wolfewiki.com/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Stories.TripTrap">Trip, Trap</a>. What's new?</p>
<ul>
<li>Some female characters instead of all-male cast</li>
<li>Lots of exploration of using technology to fight depression</li>
<li>Last of high-tech civilization is protagonist rather than villain</li>
<li>Villain is less familiar than "just" a telepathic alien</li>
</ul>
<p>Both explore the idea of advanced technology being indistinguishable
from magic (Arthur C. Clarke's quote) with fantasy and sci-fi POV
characters. Perhaps the most interesting thing about both stories, and
perhaps more so Elder Race, is the idea that there is a level of
understanding well beyond that of the high-tech human "wizard."</p>
<p>Mostly it's straightforward fun though. In the end they destroy what
they don't understand and live happily ever after.</p>

<title>Smarter, Faster, Better, by Duhigg</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>This is a very readable book that talks about motivation, teams
(psychological safety), appropriate focus, goal-setting (big and
SMART), management, decision-making, innovation, and absorbing data,
all through interesting stories. There's some good stuff.</p>
<p><img alt="cover" src="cover.jpg"></p>
<hr>
<p>Duhigg connects his book about productivity to the idea of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Power_of_Habit" title="The Power of Habit">his first book</a> on habits.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Productive people have habits—what psychologists might call
'contemplative routines'—that push them to <em>think more deeply</em> about
the choices they make." (page 6)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>The book spends substantial time exploring possible biological
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Striatum" title="Striatum">determinants</a> of motivation, and then becomes less fatalistic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Motivation is more like a skill, akin to reading or writing, that
can be learned and honed. Scientists have found that people can get
better at self-motivation if they practice the right way. The trick,
researchers say, is realizing that a prerequisite to motivation is
believing we have authority over our actions and surroundings. To
motivate ourselves, we must feel like we are in control." (page 19)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"The division [Google's People Analytics] had successfully pushed to
increase paid maternity leave from twelve to eighteen weeks because
computer models indicated that would reduce the frequency of new
mothers quitting by 50 percent." (page 42)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"In the age of automation, knowing how to manage your focus is more
critical than ever." (page 76)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Most pharaohs were considered elderly if they made it to
thirty-five." (page 194)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this is not correct; see

overlook." (page 284)</p>

<title>A Visit from the Goon Squad, by Egan</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>“Time's a goon, right?” This book is very much as described
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Visit_from_the_Goon_Squad" title="Wikipedia: A Visit from the Goon Squad">on Wikipedia</a>. I enjoyed it. It shows things from different
people's perspectives and gives you a lot of things to react to.
There's largely no singular narrative, the good aren't rewarded, the
bad aren't punished. It's most disappointing when hints of arc or
closure appear toward the end.</p>

<title>Creativity, Inc., by Catmull</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Catmull" title="Edwin 'Ed' Catmull">Catmull</a> says it's not a memoir, but of course it is, too, and
that's a good thing. I like his focus on getting fear out of
organizations and making it possible to do things, to try things,
without having rigid plans in advance. Pretty good advice throughout,
I think.</p>
<p><img alt="cover" src="cover.jpg"></p>
<hr>
<p>Catmull reminds me of the Montessori idea of a prepared environment,
when for example he discusses the effect of a particular table on his
team (page 5).</p>
<hr>
<p>He discusses fear about hiring someone smarter than him, which seems
sort of weird to me (page 23). Am I scared to hire someone smarter
than me? It's always hard to tell relative smartness, of course, but I
think in general I've been very happy, the smarter the person.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Why "Pixar"? The name emerged from a back-and-forth between Alvy
and another of our colleagues, Loren Carpenter. Alvy, who spent much
of his childhood in Texas and New Mexico, had a fondness for the
Spanish language, and was intrigued by how certain nouns in English
looked like Spanish verbs—words like "laser," for example. So Alvy
lobbied for "Pixer," which he imagined to be a (fake) Spanish verb
meaning "to make pictures." Loren countered with "Radar," which he
thought sounded more high-tech. That's when it hit them: Pixer +
radar = Pixar! It stuck." (page 30)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"["Focus, focus, focus!"] was a particular favorite piece of
nonadvice. When people hear it, they nod their heads in agreement as
if a great truth has been presented, not realizing that they've been
diverted from addressing the far harder problem: deciding what it is
that they should be focusing on. There is nothing in this advice
that gives you any idea how to figure out where the focus should be,
or how to apply your energy to it. It ends up being advice that
doesn't mean anything." (page 46)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Getting the team right is the necessary precursor to getting the
ideas right. ... Getting the right people and the right chemistry is
more important than getting the right idea." (page 74)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reminds me of "gelling" (as in <a href="/20200523-peopleware_productive_projects_and_teams/" title="Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams">Peopleware</a>).</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>""Trust the process" had morphed into "Assume that the Process Will
Fix Things for Us."" (page 79)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Imagine an old, heavy suitcase whose well-worn handles are hanging
by a few threads. The handle is "Trust the Process" or "Story is
King"—a pithy statement that seems, on the face of it, to stand for
so much more. The suitcase represents all that has gone into the
formation of the phrase: the experience, the deep wisdom, the truths
that emerge from struggle. Too often, we grab the handle and—without
realizing it—walk off without the suitcase. What's more, we don't
even think about what we've left behind. After all, the handle is so
much easier to carry around than the suitcase." (pages 79-80)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I like this image a lot. I think it connects to a lot of
learning/education.</p>
<p>The book closes with a section called "Starting points," which is five
pages of short statements, almost aphorisms, that highlight major
ideas from the book. Handles, maybe.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>""The process of developing a story is one of discovery," Pete
says." (page 113)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is interesting to me in relation to the question of whether math
is discovered or created. Surely a story is created, but this connects
to the process as being about externalizing and evaluating, connects
to <a href="https://github.com/ajschumacher/ajschumacher.github.io/issues/206">no ideas but in things</a>.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"As leaders, we should think of ourselves as teachers and try to
create companies in which teaching is seen as a valued way to
contribute to the success of the whole." (page 123)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"The problem is that our brains aren't wired to think about it
[randomness]. Instead, we are built to look for patterns in sights,
sounds, interactions, and events in the world. This mechanism is so
ingrained that we see patterns even when they aren't there. There is
a subtle reason for this: We can store patterns and conclusions in
our heads, but we cannot store randomness itself. Randomness is a
concept that defies categorization; by definition, it comes out of
nowhere and can't be anticipated. While we intellectually accept
that it exists, our brains can't completely grasp it, so it has less
impact on our consciousness than things we can see, measure, and
categorize." (page 155)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Everyone says they want to hire excellent people, but in truth we
don't <em>really</em> know, at first, who will rise up to make a
difference." (page 165)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Let's pause for a moment and look at it from the position of a
manager who is having someone manage up <em>to</em> them. I'm not talking
about brownnosing per se but more subtle forms of flattery." (page
172)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is this what managing up means? I've always thought of it as a more
positive thing, where an IC is helping guide their manager and the
organization as much as the manager guides the IC, reciprocally. But
it seems some people think of "managing up" as a negative thing?</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Craft is what we are expected to know; art is the unexpected use of
our craft." (page 196)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"And those cuts [to art programs in schools] stem from a fundamental
misconception that art classes are about learning to draw. In fact,
they are about learning to see." (page 213)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Companies, like individuals, do not become exceptional by believing
they are exceptional but by understanding the ways in which they
<em>aren't</em> exceptional." (page 215)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>""You can't manage what you can't measure" is a maxim that is taught
and believed by many in both the business and education sectors. But
in fact, the phrase is ridiculous—something said by people who are
unaware of how much is hidden. A large portion of what we manage
<em>can't</em> be measured, and not realizing this has unintended
consequences. The problem comes when people think that data paints a
full picture, leading them to ignore what they can't see." (page
219)</p>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Inspector_Armand_Gamache" title="Chief Inspector Armand Gamache">Chief Inspector Armand Gamache</a> (read "Galonche") from 2006!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘Life is change. If you aren’t growing and evolving you’re standing
still, and the rest of the world is surging ahead. Most of these
people are very immature. They lead “still” lives, waiting.’ (Myrna,
page 140)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would be very pleased if I wrote a book as good as this. It's
charming fun with a bit of morality play blended in.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘We choose our thoughts. We choose our perceptions. We choose our
attitudes. We may not think so. We may not believe it, but we do. I
absolutely know we do. I’ve seen enough evidence, time after time,
tragedy after tragedy. Triumph after triumph. It’s about choice.’
(Gamache, page 80)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stoic? Positive psychology? Right wing?</p>
<p>There's little sympathy for men's-rights-style whining:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We’re not respected just by virtue of being English. It’s not the
same thing. Do you have any idea how much our lives have changed in
the last twenty years? All the rights we’ve lost?" (Ben Hadley, page
50)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I enjoyed the art world dalliance, which reminded me somewhat of the
end of Vonnegut's Bluebeard. And Nichol! Who's never been Nichol? So
awful! So fun to hate, and/or pity.</p>
<p>I collected things of varying degrees of Canadianness that I looked
up. (Do compound bows have built-in triggers in Montreal?)</p>
<ul>
<li>as hard as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Shield">Canadian Shield</a>: a large area of exposed
   Precambrian rock</li>
<li><a href="https://carnegiemnh.org/b-is-for-beaver-sticks/">beaver stick</a>: just what it sounds like</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal_Canadiens">Canadiens</a>: the Montreal hockey team</li>
<li>cured Canadian bacon: but they mean regular bacon</li>
<li><em>dépanneur</em>: A convenience store, especially one that sells
   alcohol (in Quebec)</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eaton%27s_catalogue">Eaton's catalogue</a>: one of the first mail-order catalogs
   distributed by a Canadian retail store</li>
<li>He’s a Golden Mile boy: refers to a rich <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Square_Mile" title="Golden Square Mile">area</a> of Montreal</li>
<li>Inspector Clouseau: The Chief Inspector from The Pink Panther</li>
<li>Inuk island: apparently Inuk is interchangeable with Inuit? Is this
   a specific place?</li>
<li>"Lee Valley catalogue": "Lee Valley Tools Ltd. is a Canadian
   business specializing in tools and gifts for woodworking and
   gardening."</li>
<li>Lune Moon: a funny Canadian <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hazboy/30114619898" title="Lune Moons">snack cake</a></li>
<li>‘May I have his co-ordinates, please?’ (page 61) was asking for a
   person's location. Is this a common phrasing?</li>
<li>Méteo Media: "a Canadian French-language weather information
   specialty channel and web site"</li>
<li>tabarouette, tabarnouche: "Mild version of french-canadian curse
   word tabarnak."</li>
<li>Tabernacle: This is a curse, somehow?</li>
<li>tête carrée: "square head" / blockhead</li>
<li>three extra large ‘All Dressed’ from Pizza Pizza: "Montreal

<li>tins of soft drinks: Is this what they say in Quebec?</li>

<title>7 Habits weekly cards</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Habits-Highly-Effective-People-Anniversary/dp/1642500267" title="The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: 30th Anniversary Card Deck">It</a>'s a card a week for a year, classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_7_Habits_of_Highly_Effective_People" title="The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People">7 Habits</a> material, with
reflections and tasks for the week. I did it mostly in 2021, and I
enjoyed it. It inspired me to write a <a href="/20210226-vision_and_mission/" title="Vision and Mission">vision and mission</a>, for
example. More than the content, I like the practice of having a weekly
reflection.</p>
<p>The calendar is somewhat arbitrary, but it can be used for multiple
scales of reflection and planning. I have a <a href="/20211030-my_daily_routine/" title="My daily routine">daily practice</a>, and a
weekly practice is a nice additional layer. Maybe I should think about
a monthly equivalent as well. It's pretty common to use the
<a href="/20211228-habits_for_2022_ratio/" title="Habits for 2022: “ratio”">new year</a> for a yearly reflection and focusing too. I haven't done
five year plans, but could...</p>

<title>System Design Interview, by Xu</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>I hadn't done system design interviews before last summer when I
interviewed at Google, Uber, Facebook, Robinhood, and a few others.
Alex Xu's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/System-Design-Interview-Insiders-Guide-ebook/dp/B08B3FWYBX" title="System Design Interview – An Insider's Guide">insider's guide</a> became one of my main prep materials for
this interview type. I think it helped.</p>
<p>I was preparing for system design interviews for machine learning
engineering positions, and sort of related design questions on ML for
data science positions. Xu's book is on more general software
engineering, but I thought it was still interesting and valuable. MLE
interviews can have "regular" SWE system design components too. For
system design content more specific to machine learning, I thought
<a href="https://www.educative.io/">Educative</a> had some decent materials.</p>
<p>I think system design interviews are often trying to evaluate not just
abstract or academic knowledge, but experience, thinking, and
communication skills. Reading a book like this helps jumpstart and
review your knowledge, and is definitely valuable, but is probably not
sufficient for a truly outstanding performance. So you could start
here, but don't stop!</p>

<title>Resume dos and don'ts</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>I've thought about my resume, I've read <a href="/20220107-tech_resume_inside_out_by_orosz/" title="The Tech Resume Inside Out, by Orosz">a book about resumes</a>, and
I've reviewed hundreds of candidate resumes. Your resume is the first
work product you share with an employer. Make sure it's good. Here's a
collection of resume advice, together with some appalling errors you
wouldn't think people would make—until you see them happen.</p>
<h3>Do this</h3>
<ul>
<li>Consider your audience and what you want them to think about you.</li>
<li>Focus on what you've achieved. Provide <em>evidence</em>, not just claims.<ul>
<li>Use this pattern:
   <a href="https://www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/google-recruiters-say-these-5-resume-tips-including-x-y-z-formula-will-improve-your-odds-of-getting-hired-at-google.html" title="Google Recruiters Say Using the 'X-Y-Z Formula' on Your Resume Will Improve Your Odds of Getting Hired at Google">Accomplished X, as measured by Y, by doing Z.</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="/20200715-communicate_immediately/" title="Communicate Immediately">Communicate immediately.</a> Be direct. Be clear.</li>
<li>Use bullet-points, short sentences, rarely anything longer than one
   line.</li>
<li>Make the document look perfect. Format must be PDF.<ul>
<li>Page layout matters. 1.5 pages is worse than 1 or 2.</li>
<li>If at all possible, use LaTeX.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Don't do this</h3>
<ul>
<li>Do not include these elements (as listed by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/20/remove-these-things-from-your-resume-asap-says-ceo-who-has-read-thousands-of-resumes.html" title="Remove these 7 things from your resume ‘ASAP,’ says CEO who has read more than 1,000 resumes this year">Peter Yang</a>):<ul>
<li>Irrelevant hobbies and interests</li>
<li>Too many soft skills</li>
<li>Your professional headshot</li>
<li>Personal pronouns (As in: “Managed a team,” not “I managed a
   team”)</li>
<li>The wrong kind of email (As in: AOL or Hotmail, etc.)</li>
<li>Your mailing address (if you’re applying out-of-state)</li>
<li>Job positions older than 10 to 15 years</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://algodaily.com/lessons/the-perfect-software-engineering-resume-is-like-a-google-search-result/step-eight-8" title="from: Writing The Perfect Software Engineering Resume Is Like a Google Search Result">No Need For a Global Summary (Don't Have a Summary/Objective Section)</a></li>
<li>Include no errors in content and formatting. (See next section for
   examples.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Resume horror</h3>
<p>Your expertise should be clear from what you've done, not from some
rating scale that you use on yourself. Please no star ratings or “An
asterisk denotes *Expert level” etc.</p>
<p>Don't say “40 Hours/Week” for every job you've worked. Full time
employment is assumed. I'm thinking about resumes for salaried
positions, but even if it were hourly, I don't think I'd want to see
“40 Hours/Week” repeated over and over.</p>
<p>Links and email addresses should not have old-school underlined blue
styling. Control the formatting to make it simple and beautiful.</p>
<p>If you have links in your resume, <em>make sure you know where they go</em>.
I've seen resumes where, presumably because they used somebody else's
resume as a starting point, the link text was updated but the link
still took me to <em>somebody else's</em> LinkedIn and Twitter.</p>
<p>Pay special attention with things you're claiming expertise in: It's
hard to believe you if you say you know “CentOs”—because it's CentOS.</p>
<p>Please get the names of your prior employers correct. There is no “Red
American Cross”—it's “American Red Cross.”</p>
<p>If you are “quick to learn new tools and technics” why have you not
learned how to spell “techniques?”</p>
<p>It's easier to not use color at all than to use it well. Particularly
bad: “Wor” in blue, regular weight, with “k Experience” in bold black.
Why do that?</p>
<p>Almost nobody should include GPA(s) in their resume. Possible
exception: It's perfect, and you've never had a job. Particularly bad:
Including a mediocre GPA for one degree, with GPA then conspicuously
absent for one or more other degrees.</p>
<p>Notice how this actual section from a real resume is
self-contradictory:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Communication – Persuasive communicator, comfortable challenging the
status quo when appropriate, whether to long-standing processes or
to conventional thinking to drive greater efficiencies and outcomes.
Able to adjust communications to a diverse audience to ensure
understanding and clarity. Recognizes the importance of providing
concise, complete visualizations of complex data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Show,_don't_tell" title="Wikipedia: Show, don't tell">Show, don't tell.</a> Words without evidence are only demonstrating
that you can waste time.</p>
<p>Don't use two spaces between sentences. We're using computers.</p>
