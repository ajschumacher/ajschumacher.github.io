<title>Elder Race, by Tchaikovsky</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>As mentioned in its dedication, Tchaikovsky's 2021 short novel
<a href="https://publishing.tor.com/elderrace-adriantchaikovsky/9781250768711/">Elder Race</a> is heavily inspired by Wolfe's 1967 story
<a href="https://www.wolfewiki.com/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Stories.TripTrap">Trip, Trap</a>. What's new?</p>
<ul>
<li>Some female characters instead of all-male cast</li>
<li>Lots of exploration of using technology to fight depression</li>
<li>Last of high-tech civilization is protagonist rather than villain</li>
<li>Villain is less familiar than "just" a telepathic alien</li>
</ul>
<p>Both explore the idea of advanced technology being indistinguishable
from magic (Arthur C. Clarke's quote) with fantasy and sci-fi POV
characters. Perhaps the most interesting thing about both stories, and
perhaps more so Elder Race, is the idea that there is a level of
understanding well beyond that of the high-tech human "wizard."</p>
<p>Mostly it's straightforward fun though. In the end they destroy what
they don't understand and live happily ever after.</p>

<title>Smarter, Faster, Better, by Duhigg</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>This is a very readable book that talks about motivation, teams
(psychological safety), appropriate focus, goal-setting (big and
SMART), management, decision-making, innovation, and absorbing data,
all through interesting stories. There's some good stuff.</p>
<p><img alt="cover" src="cover.jpg"></p>
<hr>
<p>Duhigg connects his book about productivity to the idea of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Power_of_Habit" title="The Power of Habit">his first book</a> on habits.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Productive people have habits—what psychologists might call
'contemplative routines'—that push them to <em>think more deeply</em> about
the choices they make." (page 6)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>The book spends substantial time exploring possible biological
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Striatum" title="Striatum">determinants</a> of motivation, and then becomes less fatalistic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Motivation is more like a skill, akin to reading or writing, that
can be learned and honed. Scientists have found that people can get
better at self-motivation if they practice the right way. The trick,
researchers say, is realizing that a prerequisite to motivation is
believing we have authority over our actions and surroundings. To
motivate ourselves, we must feel like we are in control." (page 19)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"The division [Google's People Analytics] had successfully pushed to
increase paid maternity leave from twelve to eighteen weeks because
computer models indicated that would reduce the frequency of new
mothers quitting by 50 percent." (page 42)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"In the age of automation, knowing how to manage your focus is more
critical than ever." (page 76)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Most pharaohs were considered elderly if they made it to
thirty-five." (page 194)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this is not correct; see
<a href="/20200806-life_expectancy_is_historically_misleading/" title="Life expectancy is historically misleading">Life expectancy is historically misleading</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_disturbance_hypothesis" title="Intermediate disturbance hypothesis">Intermediate disturbance hypothesis</a></p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Productivity is about recognizing choices that other people often
overlook." (page 284)</p>

<title>A Visit from the Goon Squad, by Egan</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>“Time's a goon, right?” This book is very much as described
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Visit_from_the_Goon_Squad" title="Wikipedia: A Visit from the Goon Squad">on Wikipedia</a>. I enjoyed it. It shows things from different
people's perspectives and gives you a lot of things to react to.
There's largely no singular narrative, the good aren't rewarded, the
bad aren't punished. It's most disappointing when hints of arc or
closure appear toward the end.</p>

<title>Creativity, Inc., by Catmull</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Catmull" title="Edwin 'Ed' Catmull">Catmull</a> says it's not a memoir, but of course it is, too, and
that's a good thing. I like his focus on getting fear out of
organizations and making it possible to do things, to try things,
without having rigid plans in advance. Pretty good advice throughout,
I think.</p>
<p><img alt="cover" src="cover.jpg"></p>
<hr>
<p>Catmull reminds me of the Montessori idea of a prepared environment,
when for example he discusses the effect of a particular table on his
team (page 5).</p>
<hr>
<p>He discusses fear about hiring someone smarter than him, which seems
sort of weird to me (page 23). Am I scared to hire someone smarter
than me? It's always hard to tell relative smartness, of course, but I
think in general I've been very happy, the smarter the person.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Why "Pixar"? The name emerged from a back-and-forth between Alvy
and another of our colleagues, Loren Carpenter. Alvy, who spent much
of his childhood in Texas and New Mexico, had a fondness for the
Spanish language, and was intrigued by how certain nouns in English
looked like Spanish verbs—words like "laser," for example. So Alvy
lobbied for "Pixer," which he imagined to be a (fake) Spanish verb
meaning "to make pictures." Loren countered with "Radar," which he
thought sounded more high-tech. That's when it hit them: Pixer +
radar = Pixar! It stuck." (page 30)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"["Focus, focus, focus!"] was a particular favorite piece of
nonadvice. When people hear it, they nod their heads in agreement as
if a great truth has been presented, not realizing that they've been
diverted from addressing the far harder problem: deciding what it is
that they should be focusing on. There is nothing in this advice
that gives you any idea how to figure out where the focus should be,
or how to apply your energy to it. It ends up being advice that
doesn't mean anything." (page 46)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Getting the team right is the necessary precursor to getting the
ideas right. ... Getting the right people and the right chemistry is
more important than getting the right idea." (page 74)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reminds me of "gelling" (as in <a href="/20200523-peopleware_productive_projects_and_teams/" title="Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams">Peopleware</a>).</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>""Trust the process" had morphed into "Assume that the Process Will
Fix Things for Us."" (page 79)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Imagine an old, heavy suitcase whose well-worn handles are hanging
by a few threads. The handle is "Trust the Process" or "Story is
King"—a pithy statement that seems, on the face of it, to stand for
so much more. The suitcase represents all that has gone into the
formation of the phrase: the experience, the deep wisdom, the truths
that emerge from struggle. Too often, we grab the handle and—without
realizing it—walk off without the suitcase. What's more, we don't
even think about what we've left behind. After all, the handle is so
much easier to carry around than the suitcase." (pages 79-80)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I like this image a lot. I think it connects to a lot of
learning/education.</p>
<p>The book closes with a section called "Starting points," which is five
pages of short statements, almost aphorisms, that highlight major
ideas from the book. Handles, maybe.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>""The process of developing a story is one of discovery," Pete
says." (page 113)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is interesting to me in relation to the question of whether math
is discovered or created. Surely a story is created, but this connects
to the process as being about externalizing and evaluating, connects
to <a href="https://github.com/ajschumacher/ajschumacher.github.io/issues/206">no ideas but in things</a>.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"As leaders, we should think of ourselves as teachers and try to
create companies in which teaching is seen as a valued way to
contribute to the success of the whole." (page 123)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"The problem is that our brains aren't wired to think about it
[randomness]. Instead, we are built to look for patterns in sights,
sounds, interactions, and events in the world. This mechanism is so
ingrained that we see patterns even when they aren't there. There is
a subtle reason for this: We can store patterns and conclusions in
our heads, but we cannot store randomness itself. Randomness is a
concept that defies categorization; by definition, it comes out of
nowhere and can't be anticipated. While we intellectually accept
that it exists, our brains can't completely grasp it, so it has less
impact on our consciousness than things we can see, measure, and
categorize." (page 155)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Everyone says they want to hire excellent people, but in truth we
don't <em>really</em> know, at first, who will rise up to make a
difference." (page 165)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Let's pause for a moment and look at it from the position of a
manager who is having someone manage up <em>to</em> them. I'm not talking
about brownnosing per se but more subtle forms of flattery." (page
172)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is this what managing up means? I've always thought of it as a more
positive thing, where an IC is helping guide their manager and the
organization as much as the manager guides the IC, reciprocally. But
it seems some people think of "managing up" as a negative thing?</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Craft is what we are expected to know; art is the unexpected use of
our craft." (page 196)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"And those cuts [to art programs in schools] stem from a fundamental
misconception that art classes are about learning to draw. In fact,
they are about learning to see." (page 213)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Companies, like individuals, do not become exceptional by believing
they are exceptional but by understanding the ways in which they
<em>aren't</em> exceptional." (page 215)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>""You can't manage what you can't measure" is a maxim that is taught
and believed by many in both the business and education sectors. But
in fact, the phrase is ridiculous—something said by people who are
unaware of how much is hidden. A large portion of what we manage
<em>can't</em> be measured, and not realizing this has unintended
consequences. The problem comes when people think that data paints a
full picture, leading them to ignore what they can't see." (page
219)</p>

<title>Still Life, by Louise Penny</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>Put on your Sony ‘Discman’ and grab your palm pilot, because it's
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louise_Penny" title="Wikpedia: Louise Penny">Louise Penny</a>'s first book featuring
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Inspector_Armand_Gamache" title="Chief Inspector Armand Gamache">Chief Inspector Armand Gamache</a> (read "Galonche") from 2006!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘Life is change. If you aren’t growing and evolving you’re standing
still, and the rest of the world is surging ahead. Most of these
people are very immature. They lead “still” lives, waiting.’ (Myrna,
page 140)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would be very pleased if I wrote a book as good as this. It's
charming fun with a bit of morality play blended in.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘We choose our thoughts. We choose our perceptions. We choose our
attitudes. We may not think so. We may not believe it, but we do. I
absolutely know we do. I’ve seen enough evidence, time after time,
tragedy after tragedy. Triumph after triumph. It’s about choice.’
(Gamache, page 80)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stoic? Positive psychology? Right wing?</p>
<p>There's little sympathy for men's-rights-style whining:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We’re not respected just by virtue of being English. It’s not the
same thing. Do you have any idea how much our lives have changed in
the last twenty years? All the rights we’ve lost?" (Ben Hadley, page
50)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I enjoyed the art world dalliance, which reminded me somewhat of the
end of Vonnegut's Bluebeard. And Nichol! Who's never been Nichol? So
awful! So fun to hate, and/or pity.</p>
<p>I collected things of varying degrees of Canadianness that I looked
up. (Do compound bows have built-in triggers in Montreal?)</p>
<ul>
<li>as hard as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Shield">Canadian Shield</a>: a large area of exposed
   Precambrian rock</li>
<li><a href="https://carnegiemnh.org/b-is-for-beaver-sticks/">beaver stick</a>: just what it sounds like</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal_Canadiens">Canadiens</a>: the Montreal hockey team</li>
<li>cured Canadian bacon: but they mean regular bacon</li>
<li><em>dépanneur</em>: A convenience store, especially one that sells
   alcohol (in Quebec)</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eaton%27s_catalogue">Eaton's catalogue</a>: one of the first mail-order catalogs
   distributed by a Canadian retail store</li>
<li>He’s a Golden Mile boy: refers to a rich <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Square_Mile" title="Golden Square Mile">area</a> of Montreal</li>
<li>Inspector Clouseau: The Chief Inspector from The Pink Panther</li>
<li>Inuk island: apparently Inuk is interchangeable with Inuit? Is this
   a specific place?</li>
<li>"Lee Valley catalogue": "Lee Valley Tools Ltd. is a Canadian
   business specializing in tools and gifts for woodworking and
   gardening."</li>
<li>Lune Moon: a funny Canadian <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hazboy/30114619898" title="Lune Moons">snack cake</a></li>
<li>‘May I have his co-ordinates, please?’ (page 61) was asking for a
   person's location. Is this a common phrasing?</li>
<li>Méteo Media: "a Canadian French-language weather information
   specialty channel and web site"</li>
<li>tabarouette, tabarnouche: "Mild version of french-canadian curse
   word tabarnak."</li>
<li>Tabernacle: This is a curse, somehow?</li>
<li>tête carrée: "square head" / blockhead</li>
<li>three extra large ‘All Dressed’ from Pizza Pizza: "Montreal
   <a href="https://good-pizza-great-pizza.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_orders#All-Dressed">slang</a> for the works"</li>
<li>tins of soft drinks: Is this what they say in Quebec?</li>
<li>toques: normal winter hats, but in Canada (read "tooks")</li>
<li>to twig: To realise something; to catch on; to recognize someone or
   something (British?)</li>
<li>village cozy: A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cozy_mystery" title="Wikipedia: Cozy mystery">mystery genre</a> referenced by a character. Still
   Life is pretty close to a village cozy.</li>

<title>7 Habits weekly cards</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Habits-Highly-Effective-People-Anniversary/dp/1642500267" title="The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: 30th Anniversary Card Deck">It</a>'s a card a week for a year, classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_7_Habits_of_Highly_Effective_People" title="The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People">7 Habits</a> material, with
reflections and tasks for the week. I did it mostly in 2021, and I
enjoyed it. It inspired me to write a <a href="/20210226-vision_and_mission/" title="Vision and Mission">vision and mission</a>, for
example. More than the content, I like the practice of having a weekly
reflection.</p>
<p>The calendar is somewhat arbitrary, but it can be used for multiple
scales of reflection and planning. I have a <a href="/20211030-my_daily_routine/" title="My daily routine">daily practice</a>, and a
weekly practice is a nice additional layer. Maybe I should think about
a monthly equivalent as well. It's pretty common to use the
<a href="/20211228-habits_for_2022_ratio/" title="Habits for 2022: “ratio”">new year</a> for a yearly reflection and focusing too. I haven't done

<title>System Design Interview, by Xu</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>I hadn't done system design interviews before last summer when I
interviewed at Google, Uber, Facebook, Robinhood, and a few others.
Alex Xu's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/System-Design-Interview-Insiders-Guide-ebook/dp/B08B3FWYBX" title="System Design Interview – An Insider's Guide">insider's guide</a> became one of my main prep materials for
this interview type. I think it helped.</p>
<p>I was preparing for system design interviews for machine learning
engineering positions, and sort of related design questions on ML for
data science positions. Xu's book is on more general software
engineering, but I thought it was still interesting and valuable. MLE
interviews can have "regular" SWE system design components too. For
system design content more specific to machine learning, I thought
<a href="https://www.educative.io/">Educative</a> had some decent materials.</p>
<p>I think system design interviews are often trying to evaluate not just
abstract or academic knowledge, but experience, thinking, and
communication skills. Reading a book like this helps jumpstart and
review your knowledge, and is definitely valuable, but is probably not
sufficient for a truly outstanding performance. So you could start
here, but don't stop!</p>

<title>Resume dos and don'ts</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>I've thought about my resume, I've read <a href="/20220107-tech_resume_inside_out_by_orosz/" title="The Tech Resume Inside Out, by Orosz">a book about resumes</a>, and
I've reviewed hundreds of candidate resumes. Your resume is the first
work product you share with an employer. Make sure it's good. Here's a
collection of resume advice, together with some appalling errors you
wouldn't think people would make—until you see them happen.</p>
<h3>Do this</h3>
<ul>
<li>Consider your audience and what you want them to think about you.</li>
<li>Focus on what you've achieved. Provide <em>evidence</em>, not just claims.<ul>
<li>Use this pattern:
   <a href="https://www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/google-recruiters-say-these-5-resume-tips-including-x-y-z-formula-will-improve-your-odds-of-getting-hired-at-google.html" title="Google Recruiters Say Using the 'X-Y-Z Formula' on Your Resume Will Improve Your Odds of Getting Hired at Google">Accomplished X, as measured by Y, by doing Z.</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="/20200715-communicate_immediately/" title="Communicate Immediately">Communicate immediately.</a> Be direct. Be clear.</li>
<li>Use bullet-points, short sentences, rarely anything longer than one
   line.</li>
<li>Make the document look perfect. Format must be PDF.<ul>
<li>Page layout matters. 1.5 pages is worse than 1 or 2.</li>
<li>If at all possible, use LaTeX.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Don't do this</h3>
<ul>
<li>Do not include these elements (as listed by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/20/remove-these-things-from-your-resume-asap-says-ceo-who-has-read-thousands-of-resumes.html" title="Remove these 7 things from your resume ‘ASAP,’ says CEO who has read more than 1,000 resumes this year">Peter Yang</a>):<ul>
<li>Irrelevant hobbies and interests</li>
<li>Too many soft skills</li>
<li>Your professional headshot</li>
<li>Personal pronouns (As in: “Managed a team,” not “I managed a
   team”)</li>
<li>The wrong kind of email (As in: AOL or Hotmail, etc.)</li>
<li>Your mailing address (if you’re applying out-of-state)</li>
<li>Job positions older than 10 to 15 years</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://algodaily.com/lessons/the-perfect-software-engineering-resume-is-like-a-google-search-result/step-eight-8" title="from: Writing The Perfect Software Engineering Resume Is Like a Google Search Result">No Need For a Global Summary (Don't Have a Summary/Objective Section)</a></li>
<li>Include no errors in content and formatting. (See next section for
   examples.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Resume horror</h3>
<p>Your expertise should be clear from what you've done, not from some
rating scale that you use on yourself. Please no star ratings or “An
asterisk denotes *Expert level” etc.</p>
<p>Don't say “40 Hours/Week” for every job you've worked. Full time
employment is assumed. I'm thinking about resumes for salaried
positions, but even if it were hourly, I don't think I'd want to see
“40 Hours/Week” repeated over and over.</p>
<p>Links and email addresses should not have old-school underlined blue
styling. Control the formatting to make it simple and beautiful.</p>
<p>If you have links in your resume, <em>make sure you know where they go</em>.
I've seen resumes where, presumably because they used somebody else's
resume as a starting point, the link text was updated but the link
still took me to <em>somebody else's</em> LinkedIn and Twitter.</p>
<p>Pay special attention with things you're claiming expertise in: It's
hard to believe you if you say you know “CentOs”—because it's CentOS.</p>
<p>Please get the names of your prior employers correct. There is no “Red
American Cross”—it's “American Red Cross.”</p>
<p>If you are “quick to learn new tools and technics” why have you not
learned how to spell “techniques?”</p>
<p>It's easier to not use color at all than to use it well. Particularly
bad: “Wor” in blue, regular weight, with “k Experience” in bold black.
Why do that?</p>
<p>Almost nobody should include GPA(s) in their resume. Possible
exception: It's perfect, and you've never had a job. Particularly bad:
Including a mediocre GPA for one degree, with GPA then conspicuously
absent for one or more other degrees.</p>
<p>Notice how this actual section from a real resume is
self-contradictory:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Communication – Persuasive communicator, comfortable challenging the
status quo when appropriate, whether to long-standing processes or
to conventional thinking to drive greater efficiencies and outcomes.
Able to adjust communications to a diverse audience to ensure
understanding and clarity. Recognizes the importance of providing
concise, complete visualizations of complex data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Show,_don't_tell" title="Wikipedia: Show, don't tell">Show, don't tell.</a> Words without evidence are only demonstrating
that you can waste time.</p>
<p>Don't use two spaces between sentences. We're using computers.</p>

<title>The Tech Resume Inside Out, by Orosz</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>I read <a href="https://thetechresume.com/" title="The Tech Resume Inside Out: What a Good Developer Resume Looks Like">this</a> when I was re-doing my resume last spring, and I think
it helped. Here are some changes to my resume that I made based on its
advice:</p>
<ul>
<li>With double the experience, I cut the length in half to get to one
   page.</li>
<li>I dropped my full address, keeping just city and state.</li>
<li>I put job titles before and more prominently than employer names.</li>
<li>Instead of paragraphs describing jobs, 16 bullet-points, all single
   lines.</li>
<li>Lots of active voice, immediate quantitative detail, and specifics.</li>
<li>Instead of a separate section, programming languages etc. mentioned
   in context.</li>
<li>I dropped months, so dates of employment only include years.</li>
</ul>
<p>I didn't make a separate resume for <em>every</em> position I applied for,
but I did distribute at least six different versions for different
kinds of roles.</p>
<p>Do resumes matter? I'm not sure. You probably still need to have one
though. And it may be that the <em>less</em> they matter, the better the
signal you provide by <em>still</em> having a good one. People who are great
do the little things well.</p>
<p>If nothing else, thinking about your resume can focus your work: How
would what I'm doing today look on my resume? If you're doing
something that would seem pointless on a resume, maybe you should do
something else.</p>

<title>Radium Girls, by Moore</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>I like that <a href="https://www.kate-moore.com/" title="Kate Moore">Moore</a> writes with purpose; all her books expose
injustice against and give voice to women (with the possible exception
of the Felix the Railway Cat series; I'm not sure about those).
<a href="https://www.theradiumgirls.com/" title="The Radium Girls">The Radium Girls</a> stays readable over nearly 500 pages, conveying
history that feels relevant to current issues of business, law,
rights, and risks.</p>
<p><strong>Capitalism can be stupid and mean</strong>: Several businesspeople seem
Trump-like in their disregard for ethics in the pursuit of profit.
It's hard to take a libertarian point of view with externalities like
these. And radium dials at least look cool, but many radium businesses
sold absolute snake oil. I noticed today that a company will sell you
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/01/style/gummies-edibles-marijuana-diet.html" title="Counterculture to Counterintuitive: Cannabis to Help You Diet? An edibles company says one of its products will lead not to the “the munchies” but to weight loss. There’s just one problem: the science.">marijuana gummies for weight loss</a>. Maybe not much has changed.</p>
<p><strong>Ignorance and geography</strong>: It was much harder, it seemed, to find a
competent doctor or lawyer in small-town Illinois, compared to the New
York metropolitan area. It seems there was more religiosity in the
middle west as well. It also struck me as strange that terminal
patients were generally not told that they were terminal. Is that
still the case? Is ignorance really better in such cases?</p>
<p><strong>Weaponizing “experts”</strong>: As with radium, so with cigarettes and
opioids and climate change and on and on... The pursuit of knowledge
pushed behind debate-club he-said/she-said and outright lies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"But if you looked a little closer at all those positive
publications, there was a common denominator: the researchers, on
the whole, worked for radium firms. As radium was such a rare and
mysterious element, its commercial exploiters in fact controlled, to
an almost monopolizing extent, its image and most of the knowledge
about it. Many firms had their own radium-themed journals, which
were distributed free to doctors, all full of optimistic research.
The firms that profited from radium medicine were the primary
producers and publishers of the positive literature." (page 49)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Dangers with delayed effects</strong>: Radium took years, usually, to have
negative effects on the radium dial painters. What risks do we
currently not know or underestimate?</p>
<ul>
<li>Climate change? Microplastics?</li>
<li>Social media? Entertainment?</li>
<li>Unemployment? Overemployment?</li>
<li>Migration? Lack of migration?</li>
<li>Trends in education?</li>
<li>Kombucha?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Gender and class</strong>: Moore highlights inequities in societal
attention and care. For example, "It seemed wealthy consumers were
much more worthy of protection than working-class girls..." (page 273)
It reminds me of the 21st-century popularization of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Neel" title="Wikipedia: Alice Neel">Alice Neel</a>,
who similarly focused on working people and "the female gaze." How far
is there still to go?</p>
<p><strong>The legal system</strong>: The tales of slow and capricious legal
processes, out-of-court settlements, rhetoric over reality, the
influence of wealth, and general nonsense... The 1920s and 30s sound
very much like the present.</p>

<p>Caveats:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm pretty sure I've identified the right answers, but I haven't
   seen an answer key (just the relevant test booklets).</li>
<li>The actual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordsum" title="Wikipedia: Wordsum">WORDSUM</a> has 10 questions, not 20. I know that those
   ten questions are among these 20, but I don't know <em>which</em>. For
   more detail, read on.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's an <a href="https://gss.norc.org/Documents/reports/methodological-reports/MR111%20The%20Psychometric%20Properties%20of%20the%20GSS%20Wordsum%20Vocabulary%20Test.pdf" title="The Psychometric Properties of the GSS Wordsum Vocabulary Test">excerpt</a> on the history of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordsum" title="Wikipedia: Wordsum">WORDSUM</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the early 1920s, Edward L. Thorndike developed a lengthy
vocabulary test as part of the I.E.R. Intelligence Scale CAVD to
measure, in his words, “verbal intelligence.” As in the modern-day
Wordsum test, each question asked respondents to identify the word
or phrase in a set of five whose meaning was closest to a target
word. Robert L. Thorndike (1942) later extracted two subsets of the
original test, each containing twenty items of varying difficulty.
For each subset, two target words were selected at each of ten
difficulty levels. The ten items in Wordsum (labeled with letters
A though J) were selected from the first of these two subsets.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's not perfectly accurate to say Thorndike developed a lengthy
vocabulary test. The I.E.R Intelligence Scale CAVD, <a href="https://copyright.cornell.edu/publicdomain" title="Copyright at Cornell Libraries: Copyright Term and the Public Domain">copyright</a> 1925
and 1926, is 17 levels (A through Q) and each level has ten vocabulary
questions in multiple choice format, among other question types.</p>
<p>Thorndike 1942 is <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1942-04205-001" title="Thorndike, R. L. (1942). Two screening tests of verbal intelligence. Journal of Applied Psychology, 26(2), 128–135.">Two screening tests of verbal intelligence</a>,
which describes how two 20-word tests “containing two words from each
of the levels of CAVD from H through Q” (the more difficult end of the
spectrum; levels A through E use pictures) were constructed.</p>
<p><img alt="two forms" src="two_forms.png"></p>
<p>The first subset then is <em>Form A</em>, and those are the questions
included above. I don't know <em>which</em> ten words from Form A's twenty
are in WORDSUM, however. As <a href="https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org/documents/444/display" title="GSS Codebook Appendix D">GSS Codebook Appendix D</a> explains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To minimize the admittedly small possibility that some form of
publicity would affect the public's knowledge of the words included
in the test, they are not reported here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think it's fascinating that a vocab test from the 1920s is part of
the GSS, which continues to be administered in the 2020s. I think it's
fascinating that WORDSUM has been used for evidence that
<a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Intelligence-makes-people-think-like-economists%3A-Caplan-Miller/ef579356c5c461914e3c0ff896c7949554be1774" title="Intelligence makes people think like economists: Evidence from the General Social Survey">Intelligence makes people think like economists</a>, among many other
things.</p>
<p>I think the benefit of knowing what the WORDSUM questions are far
outweighs any risk “that some form of publicity would affect the
public's knowledge of the words included in the test.” Frankly, I'm
not sure WORDSUM deserves an encomium.</p>

<title>Predicting the future from 2022</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>For the third year in a row (<a href="/20200112-predicting_the_future_from_2020/" title="Predicting the Future from 2020">2020</a>, <a href="/20210102-predicting_the_future_from_2021/" title="Predicting the future from 2021">2021</a>) I consider what might
happen. I continue to mostly imagine current trends continue, and
throw in some extra stuff for fun.</p>
<h3>By 2023 (1 year from now)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Omicron is the last major Covid variant, but supply chain and
   workforce issues continue to be hard all year.</li>
<li>Democrats become minorities in the House and Senate in 2022 US elections.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II" title="Wikipedia: Elizabeth II">Queen Elizabeth</a> is dead. (Recommended by Tonia.)</li>
<li>Inflation carries on around 5%.</li>
<li>S&amp;P 500 closes above 5,000.</li>
</ul>
<h3>By 2027 (5 years from now)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Democratic candidate wins presidency in 2024 US election.</li>
<li>Inflation around 2%.</li>
<li>Global population exceeds 8 billion for the first time in 2023
   (<a href="https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/" title="Total Population - Both Sexes (XLSX, 2.4 MB)">predicted</a> by the UN).</li>
<li>Total population between 8,221,264 and 8,333,078 (low/med
   <a href="https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/" title="Total Population - Both Sexes (XLSX, 2.4 MB)">predicted</a> by the UN).</li>
<li>S&amp;P 500 closes above 7,000.</li>
</ul>
<h3>By 2032 (10 years from now)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Texas has non-zero state income tax and plenty of climate and
   infrastructure things to spend on.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zendaya" title="Wikipedia: Zendaya">Zendaya</a> wins an Oscar.</li>
<li>At least one European nation has something identifiable as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_basic_income" title="Wikipedia: Universal Basic Income">UBI</a>.</li>
<li>Total population between 8,445,932 and 8,687,228 (low/med
   <a href="https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/" title="Total Population - Both Sexes (XLSX, 2.4 MB)">predicted</a> by the UN).</li>
<li>S&amp;P 500 closes above 9,000.</li>
</ul>
<h3>By 2042 (20 years from now)</h3>
<ul>
<li>The US effectively has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_basic_income" title="Wikipedia: Universal Basic Income">UBI</a>, but it isn't called that. Maybe a
   patchwork of policies.</li>
<li>At least one international advertising campaign intended to
   encourage immigration to the US by ameliorating the reputation of
   unemployed Americans.</li>
<li>Total population between 8,769,695 and 9,315,508 (low/med
   <a href="https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/" title="Total Population - Both Sexes (XLSX, 2.4 MB)">predicted</a> by the UN).</li>
<li>S&amp;P 500 closes above 15,000.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Trends</h3>
<ul>
<li>I think global population growth will be <em>slightly</em> slower than the
   medium variant <a href="https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/" title="Total Population - Both Sexes (XLSX, 2.4 MB)">predicted</a> by the UN. Covid might contribute a
   little, but I think this is mostly from efforts like Bill Gates's,
   possibly Belt and Road, and general technology and modernization.</li>
<li>Climate change continues. More fires, more floods, more droughts,
   more storms. Climate action continues to be nominal.</li>
<li>It keeps being easy/easier to fake things.<ul>
<li>Lots of cheap/low-quality stuff.</li>
<li>The value of direct human relationships/trust stays very
   high/grows. Elite college education keeps getting more
   valuable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Inequality continues to grow.<ul>
<li>Extreme poverty continues to decline; the bottom of the range
   is higher than previously. In some places, there may be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_basic_income" title="Wikipedia: Universal Basic Income">UBI</a>
   eventually.</li>
<li>But the gap between the bottom of the range and the top grows.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>More legalization of drugs.</li>
<li>There will continue to be more real problems with not having enough
   people to work than there are with having too many people put out
   of work by technology.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Wilder speculations</h3>
<ul>
<li>“The middle class is precarious.” To what extent is <em>downward</em>
   mobility present? acceptable? desirable? To what extent is/should
   mobility be like a ratchet: only upward? The idle rich are not
   generally admired as virtuous, I think, but people also really
   dislike it when their children are worse off than they are/were (or
   if they're those children). What will be the long-term trend? What
   level of wealth should anyone have to “earn”? (Inspired by Emilie.)</li>
<li>Infant (and child) mortality is dramatically <a href="/20200806-life_expectancy_is_historically_misleading/" title="Life expectancy is historically misleading">down</a> and will
   likely continue to get lower. The first-order effect is obviously
   good. What are the second-order effects? Does the decrease in
   infant mortality contribute to any population health effects?</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Reviewing past predictions</h3>
<p>I was a little crazy in <a href="/20210102-predicting_the_future_from_2021/" title="Predicting the future from 2021">2021</a>. Depending on the level of generosity
in interpretation, I was somewhere from 1/4 to 4/4 on one-year
predictions. None of my longer-term predictions have materialized.
Still no aliens.</p>
<p>From <a href="/20200112-predicting_the_future_from_2020/" title="Predicting the Future from 2020">2020</a>: Hong Kong <a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/50319384/how-democracy-was-dismantled-in-hong-kong-in-2021" title="How democracy was dismantled in Hong Kong in 2021">seems to be</a> pretty well controlled by the

<title>A Calendar of Wisdom, by Tolstoy</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>In 2021, I followed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Tolstoy" title="Wikipedia: Leo Tolstoy">Tolstoy</a>'s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Calendar_of_Wisdom" title="A Calendar of Wisdom">Calendar of Wisdom</a>. It's a
page-a-day calendar, circa 1910, with a little more gravitas. I like
the concept but I don't always agree with Tolstoy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Guiding your thoughts is one of the keys to self-perfection."
(August 9)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tolstoy is quite religious, pacifist, vegetarian, and
back-to-the-earth. He mixes quotes and paraphrases with his own
commentary and aphorisms. I can't quite recommend it all because I
find some things objectionable, but I like the idea of having
something to reflect on daily. Some of my most and least favorite
selections are below.</p>
<p><img alt="cover" src="cover.jpg"></p>
<hr>
<h3>Not bad, Tolstoy</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"To accept the dignity of another person is an axiom." (April 16)</p>
<p>"<em>Effort is the necessary condition of moral perfection.</em>" (July 23)</p>
<p>"When a person tries to apply his intellect to the question “Why do
I exist in this world?” he becomes dizzy. The human intellect cannot
find the answers to such questions." (July 29)</p>
<p>"Think good thoughts, and your thoughts will be turned into good
actions. Everything begins in thought. Guiding your thoughts is one
of the keys to self-perfection." (August 9)</p>
<p>"<em>Real goodness is not something that can be acquired in an instant,
but only through constant effort, because real goodness lies in
constantly striving for perfection.</em>" (September 4)</p>
<p>"You should abstain from arguments. They are very illogical ways to
convince people. Opinions are like nails: the stronger you hit them,
the deeper inside they go." (November 4, quoting Decimus Junius
Juvenalis)</p>
<p>"The more urgently you want to speak, the more likely it is that you
will say something foolish." (November 4)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h3>No thanks, Tolstoy</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>A marriage is a special obligation between two people, of opposite
sexes, to have children only with each other. To break this pact is
a lie, a deception, and a crime.</em>" (March 11)</p>
<p>"We can improve this world only by distributing the true faith among
the world's people." (March 17)</p>
<p>"You should never feel depressed.</p>
<p>A man should always feel happy; if he is unhappy, it means he is
guilty." (June 29)</p>
<p>"People know little, because they try to understand those things
which are not open to them for understanding: God, eternity, spirit;
or those which are not worth thinking about: how water becomes
frozen, or a new theory of numbers, or how viruses can transmit
illnesses." (July 27)</p>
<p>"Only religion destroys egoism and selfishness, so that one starts
to live life not only for himself. Only religion destroys the fear
of death, only religion gives us the meaning of life, only religion
creates equality among people, only religion sets a person free from
outer pressures." (August 18)</p>
<p>"It is dangerous to disseminate the idea that our life is purely the
product of material forces and that it depends entirely on these
forces." (August 22)</p>
<p>"<em>Faith is the foundation on which all else rests; it is the root of
all knowledge.</em>" (August 28)</p>
<p>"Though the mission of a woman's life is the same as that of a man's
life and the service to God is fulfilled by the same means, namely
love, for the majority of women the method of this service is more
specific than for men. This is the birth and upbringing of new
workers for the Lord throughout life." (December 1)</p>
<p>"There is nothing more natural for a woman than self-sacrifice."
(December 1)</p>

<title>Getting var(X/Y) can be hard</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>There generally isn't an analytic solution for the variance of the
ratio of two random variables (or probability distributions).
Denominators around zero are a problem, and with variance large
relative to mean, the approximation using the delta method may be
worse than you expect.</p>
<p>If you're dividing by something that can be close to zero, the results
can get big, which affects variance. Dividing two standard normal
distributions gives you a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy_distribution" title="Wikipediia: Cauchy distribution">Cauchy distribution</a>, for example, and
the variance there is undefined. So if you're near zero, watch out!
Variance may not make sense, and can at least be hard to estimate.</p>
<p>The approximation of the variance of a ratio using the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_method" title="Delta method">delta method</a> is:</p>
<p>\[ \text{var} \left( \frac{X}{Y} \right) \approx \frac{1}{\overline{Y}^2} \text{var} \left( X \right) + \frac{ \overline{X}^2 }{ \overline{Y}^4 } \text{var} \left( Y \right) - 2 \frac{ \overline{X} }{ \overline{Y}^3 } \text{cov} \left( X, Y \right) \]</p>
<p>See <a href="https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~hseltman/files/ratio.pdf" title="Approximations for Mean and Variance of a Ratio">Seltman</a> for a derivation. Also presented in <a href="/20211229-trustworthy_online_controlled_experiments/" title="Trustworthy Online Controlled Experiments">Kohavi et al.</a>
and <a href="http://alexdeng.github.io/public/files/WSDM2017draft.pdf" title="Trustworthy analysis of online A/B tests: Pitfalls, challenges and solutions">Deng et al.</a></p>
<p>This is an approximation based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor%27s_theorem" title="Wikipedia: Taylor's theorem">Taylor series expansion</a>, and it
isn't always super close, even for seemingly simple examples like this
one in <a href="https://www.r-project.org/" title="The R Project for Statistical Computing">R</a>, with uniform distributions:</p>
<!-- set.seed(42) -->

<pre><code class="language-r">approx_var_ratio &lt;- function(x, y) {
  (1 / mean(y)^2) * var(x) +
    (mean(x)^2 / mean(y)^4) * var(y) -
    2 * (mean(x) / mean(y)^3) * cov(x, y)
}

x = runif(1000, min=14, max=26)
y = runif(1000, min= 4, max=16)

approx_var_ratio(x, y)
## 0.6286227
var(x/y)
## 1.189362</code></pre>

<p>That's no fluke of sampling. The delta-based formula is consistently
under 60% of the empirical value, for these parameters.</p>
<p>It isn't just a weirdness of the uniform distribution either. The
approximation is agnostic to distribution—which is another hint that
it can't be perfectly right, at least not always. Here's an example
with Gaussians, truncated so there's no risk of outliers near zero:</p>
<!--
install.packages("truncnorm")
library(truncnorm)

set.seed(42)
-->

<pre><code class="language-r">x = rtruncnorm(1000, a=14, mean=20, b=26, sd=3)
y = rtruncnorm(1000, a= 4, mean=10, b=16, sd=3)

approx_var_ratio(x, y)
## 0.3323209
var(x/y)
## 0.5294384</code></pre>

<p>That's still a substantial underestimate.</p>
<p>The approximation gets better when means are bigger relative to
variances. For example:</p>
<!-- set.seed(42) -->

<pre><code class="language-r">x = rnorm(1000, mean=200, sd=3)
y = rnorm(1000, mean=100, sd=3)

approx_var_ratio(x, y)
## 0.004369166
var(x/y)
## 0.004381438</code></pre>

<p>Now it's quite close.</p>
<p>A distribution with appreciable mass near zero has a large variance
relative to its mean, but you don't have to be near zero for the
relative spread of the distribution to affect the quality of the
approximation. Especially clear of zero, I think Monte Carlo
estimation can be better than using the formula based on the delta
method.</p>
<p>In conclusion, approximations are approximations. Do you really <em>need</em>
a ratio?</p>
<p>Stay safe out there!</p>

<title>Trustworthy Online Controlled Experiments</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>The <a href="https://exp-platform.com/hippo/" title="HiPPO FAQ">HiPPO</a> on the cover represents the “Highest Paid Person's
Opinion” and the <a href="https://experimentguide.com/" title="Trustworthy Online Controlled Experiments: A Practical Guide to A/B Testing">book</a> is about making decisions in industry based
on experiments instead. It includes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twyman%27s_law">Twyman's Law</a> and much more and
is <em>the</em> text to read for online A/B tests. It does have some of the
character of class notes from a busy prof, with details left in other
papers, and the occasional misattribution (quote page 153) and error
(“due to the increase in power that comes from the increase in power”
page 170). Indispensable, but some assembly required.</p>
<p><img alt="cover" src="cover.jpg"></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"In statistics, this [Overall Evaluation Criterion (OEC)] is often
called the <em>Response</em> or <em>Dependent</em> variable (Mason, Gunst and Hess
1989, Box, Hunter and Hunter 2005); other synonyms are <em>Outcome</em>,
<em>Evaluation</em> and <em>Fitness Function</em> (Quarto-vonTivadar 2006).
Experiments can have multiple objectives and analysis can use a
balanced scorecard approach (Kaplan and Norton 1996), although
selecting a single metric, possibly as a weighted combination of
such objectives is highly desired and recommended (Roy 2001, 50,
405-429)." (page 7)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Roy <a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Design+of+Experiments+Using+The+Taguchi+Approach%3A+16+Steps+to+Product+and+Process+Improvement-p-9780471361015">citation</a> is "Design of Experiments Using The Taguchi
Approach: 16 Steps to Product and Process Improvement". "Step 16" is
"Case studies", so I think Roy has confused "step" with "chapter".</p>

<p>"However, Google's tweaks to the color scheme
[<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/01/business/01marissa.html">the 41 blues test</a>] ended up being substantially positive on
user engagement (note that Google does not report on the results of
individual changes) and led to a strong partnership between design
and experimentation moving forward." (page 16)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is an interesting take... They say (while saying they can't
support it with evidence) that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/01/business/01marissa.html">the 41 blues test</a> was good in
multiple ways, while the popular lore is mostly about how at least one
designer cited that experimentation as the <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/2009/03/20/41-shades-of-blue/">reason</a> they quit
Google. Hmm.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"If we use <em>purchase indicator</em> (i.e., did the user purchase yes/no,
without regard to the purchase amount) instead of using
<em>revenue-per-user</em> as our OEC, the standard error will be smaller,
meaning that we will not need to expose the experiment to as many
users to achieve the same sensitivity." (page 32)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This strikes me as an oversimplification... The measurements aren't on
the same scale, for one, so what does it mean to have a smaller
standard error, exactly? The two are testing different things... You
could imagine a world where the experimental condition convinces 100%
of users to make a $1 purchase, but stops the 5% of users who were
previously making $100 purchases. That's not good. I bet the authors
meant something more precise, and I wish they would have said what.</p>

<p>"In the analysis of controlled experiments, it is common to apply

for single-layer randomization, but which failed to properly
distribute users in multiple concurrent experiments when the system
was generalized to overlapping experiments. Cryptographic hash

<p>"Combining Key Metrics into an OEC"</p>
<p>"Given the common situation where you have multiple goal and driver
metrics, what do you do? Do you need to choose just one metric, or
do you keep more than one? Do you combine them all into single
combination metric?"</p>
<p>"While some books advocate focusing on just one metric (<em>Lean
Analytics</em> (Croll and Yoskovitz 2013) suggest the One Metric that
Matters (OMTM) and <em>The 4 Disciplines of Execution</em> (McChesney,
Covey and Huling 2012) suggest focusing on Wildly Important Goal
(WIG)), we find that motivating but an oversimplification. Except
for trivial scenarios, there is usually no single metric that
captures what a business is optimizing for. Kaplan and Norton (1996)
give a good example: imagine entering a modern jet airplane. Is
there a single metric that you should put on the pilot's dashboard?
Airspeed? Altitude? Remaining fuel? You know the pilot must have
access to these metrics and more. When you have an online business,
you will have several key goal and driver metrics, typically
measuring user engagement (e.g., active days, sessions-per-user,
clicks- per-user) and monetary value (e.g., revenue-per-user). There
is usually no simple single metric to optimize for."</p>
<p>"In practice, many organizations examine multiple key metrics, and
have a mental model of the tradeoffs they are willing to accept when
they see any particular combination. For example, they may have a
good idea about how much they are willing to lose (churn) users if
the remaining users increase their engagement and revenue to more
than compensate. Other organizations that prioritize growth may not
be willing to accept a similar tradeoff."</p>
<p>"Oftentimes, there is a mental model of the tradeoffs, and devising
a single metric — an OEC — that is a weighted combination of the
such objectives (Roy 2001, 50, 405-429) may be the more desired
solution. And like metrics overall, ensuring that the metrics and
the combination are not gameable is critical (see <em>Sidebar:
Gameability</em> in Chapter 6). For example, basketball scoreboards
don't keep track of shots beyond the two- and three-point lines,
only the combined score for each team, which is the OEC. FICO credit
scores combine multiple metrics into a single score ranging from 300
to 850. The ability to have a single summary score is typical in
sports and critical for business. A single metric makes the exact
definition of success clear and has a similar value to agreeing on
metrics in the first place: it aligns people in an organization
about the tradeoffs. Moreover, by having the discussion and making
the tradeoffs explicit, there is more consistency in decision making
and people can better understand the limitations of the combination
to determine when the OEC itself needs to evolve. This approach
empowers teams to make decisions without having to escalate to
management and provides an opportunity for automated searches
(parameter sweeps)."</p>
<p>"If you have multiple metrics, one possibility proposed by Roy
(2001) is to normalize each metric to a predefined range, say 0-1,
and assign each a weight. Your OEC is the weighted sum of the
normalized metrics." (pages 104-105)</p>

<p>"Experiment randomization can also act as a great instrumental
variable." (page 114)</p>

<p>Hmm! I guess this would be the case if you found the experiment had
some effect on <em>X</em>, and then you were interested in further effects of
<em>X</em> on other things. See: <a href="/20210430-a_simple_instrumental_variable/">A simple Instrumental Variable</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w17345">The Effect of Providing Peer Information on Retirement Savings Decisions</a> (ref page 119; abstract shown here)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We conducted a field experiment in a 401(k) plan to measure the
effect of disseminating information about peer behavior on savings.
Low-saving employees received simplified plan enrollment or
contribution increase forms. A randomized subset of forms stated the
fraction of age-matched coworkers participating in the plan or
age-matched participants contributing at least 6% of pay to the

information decreased the savings of non-participants who were
ineligible for 401(k) automatic enrollment, and higher observed peer
savings rates also decreased savings. Discouragement from upward
social comparisons seems to drive this reaction.</p>

significance, you'll have your answer,” and “When the test has
reached a statistically significance conclusion ...” (Kohavi 2014).
The statistics commonly used assume that a single test will be made
at the end of the experiment and “peeking” violates that assumption,
leading to many more false positives than expected using classical
hypothesis testing.</p>
<p>Early versions of Optimizely encouraged peeking and thus early
stopping, leading to many false successes. When some experimenters
started to run A/A tests, they realized this, leading to articles
such as “How Optimizely (Almost) Got Me Fired” (Borden 2014). To
their credit, Optimizely worked with experts in the field, such as
Ramesh Johari, Leo Pekelis, and David Walsh, and updated their
evaluations, dubbing it “Optimizely's New Stats Engine” (Pekelis

resolving the issue." (page 205)</p>

<title>Habits for 2022: “ratio”</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>In 2021, I worked on improving my <a href="/20211030-my_daily_routine/" title="My daily routine">daily routine</a>. I need to keep
working on it, but as 2022 approaches, I was thinking about other
changes to make. In the CGP Grey “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVGuFdX5guE&amp;ab_channel=CGPGrey" title="CGP Grey: Your Theme">theme</a>” style, I might say
“ratio” as in “ratio of quality to junk.” Here are some practices I
think can support this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Only check the news on Sundays.</strong> I check the news (and my phone
   generally) too much, and it doesn't really make my life better to
   check the news several times a day. Sunday is the day for news.</li>
<li><strong>Keep a book ready in Kindle app.</strong> When I <em>do</em> pick up my phone,
   there should be something worthwhile there. Read a book, or put the
   phone down.</li>
<li><strong>Skim more.</strong> I overcommit to reading things the slow way, which
   takes a lot of time and prevents me from opening books I don't want
   to commit to. I hate the phrase “speed reading” because I don't
   think it's real reading, but skimming in the sense of “survey” in
   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQ3R" title="survey, question, read, recite and review">SQ3R</a> is a distinct thing that's worthwhile. I recently did a
   quick <a href="/20211213-practical_data_science_with_python_by_george/" title="Practical Data Science with Python, by George">book review</a> based on skimming and I thought it was fair
   and I learned a few things too. Skimming could get me connected
   with my backlog of nonfiction.</li>
</ul>

<title>The Genetic Lottery, by Harden</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>Harden has something for everyone to dislike, telling the left that
environment isn't everything and telling the right that
self-determination isn't everything. I think her recommendation to use
genetic controls in statistical analysis is interesting but hard.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The biggest contribution of genetics to the social sciences is to
give researchers an additional set of tools to do basic research by
measuring and statistically controlling for a variable—DNA—that has
previously been very difficult to measure and statistically control
for." (page 192)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691190808/the-genetic-lottery" title="The Genetic Lottery: Why DNA Matters for Social Equality">The Genetic Lottery</a> has received criticism. Here's
<a href="https://www.lareviewofbooks.org/article/why-dna-is-no-key-to-social-equality-on-kathryn-paige-hardens-the-genetic-lottery" title="Why DNA Is No Key to Social Equality: On Kathryn Paige Harden’s “The Genetic Lottery”">Henn et al.</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Ultimately, [Harden's] focus on genetics as a fundamental cause of
social inequality reduces her version of social justice to
benevolent paternalism."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think Harden does a fair job of being clear that genetics can be a
cause, but certainly not the only cause, and not a cause that can't be
redressed. On “benevolent paternalism,” I think Henn et al. intend the
phrase to have negative connotation, but couldn't any attempt at
social justice (or social safety nets) be referred to in this way?</p>
<p>As in the “equality vs. equity” <a href="https://interactioninstitute.org/illustrating-equality-vs-equity/">cartoon</a> on page 162, I take it as
a given that everyone should be able to see over the fence—the hard
question is how high the fence that we're trying to get everybody over
is. What's the level that should be guaranteed, and what are
exceptions for extreme cases?</p>
<p>Bird has <a href="https://massivesci.com/articles/genetic-lottery-review-paige-harden-kevin-bird/" title="The Genetic Lottery is a bust for both genetics and policy">issues</a> with the presentation of the science, and I agree
I would have liked more detail and precision in the presentation, but
Harden is also trying to reach a broad audience and cover a lot of
material. I think Bird is incorrect in his accusation that Harden
doesn't engage with the history of eugenics.</p>
<p>Harden's point that genetic confounds can affect optimal policy
recommendations seems meaningful to me. If parents with lots of books
in their home have kids who learn to read, does that imply giving
everyone a stack of books is all we need to do?</p>
<p>I think Harden is right that if the well-intentioned don't engage with
genetics, their impact is muted by confounding while the
ill-intentioned advertise “forbidden knowledge” to the benefit of
none. But I don't expect a major shift in Harden's lifetime.</p>

<title>Correlation can help approximate variance of a difference</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>Even if random variables \( \textbf{A} \) and \( \textbf{δ} \) are
uncorrelated, realized data \( A \) and \( \delta \) will happen
to have some covariance. If \( B = A + \delta \), then \(
\text{var}(B) = \text{var}(A) + \text{var}(\delta) + 2\text{cov}(A,
\delta) \), and estimating any one variance by the others will be off
by the \( 2\text{cov}(A, \delta) \) term. For \( \text{var}(\delta)
\), however, the estimate \( \text{var}(B)(1 - \text{corr}(A, B)^2)
\) will usually be closer to correct, at the cost of being slightly
biased. (But don't forget that doing \( \text{var}( \delta ) \)
directly is a great first choice.)</p>
<h3>Three methods for \( \text{var}( \delta ) \), when \( B = A + \delta \)</h3>
<p>The case of \( B = A + \delta \) (so that \( \delta = B - A \)) is
central to the paired t-test, for example. The variance of \( A \)
and \( B \) could each be large, but the variance of \( \delta \)
can still be small, making it easier to reject the null for \(
\textbf{δ} \), for example.</p>
<p><em>Be careful: We're trying to estimate a variance, so we're interested
in the variance of the estimate of the variance, which can be
confusing. Hopefully the language is clear enough here.</em></p>
<h4>1) Variance of Differences</h4>
<p>The obvious thing to do is to subtract and calculate the variance of
the differences: \( \text{var}( \delta ) = \text{var}( B - A ) \).
This is a good idea and what you should do. It's unbiased and has low
variance (for the estimate of the true variance of \( \textbf{δ}
\)).</p>
<p>Why not do it like this? Honestly I'm not sure. Maybe you don't have
complete data, and you're looking for a \( \delta_1 - \delta_2 \)
where the means of \( A_1 \) and \( A_2 \) are assumed equal so
you're using \( B_1 - B_2 \) but you want the (smaller) variance of
\( \delta_1 - \delta_2 \)? So you'll estimate some things with
complete cases even though the main effect is estimated with all \( B
\) data? Why not still use this method with the complete cases? Maybe
you're not using simple subtraction, but some more complex regression
with multiple variables? In that case, why not use variance of the
residuals directly? Do you just want a more complicated method?</p>
<h4>2) Difference of Variances</h4>
<p>By the <a href="/20201030-the_variance_sum_law_is_interesting/">variance sum law</a>, \( \text{var}( \textbf{B} ) =
\text{var}( \textbf{A} ) + \text{var}( \textbf{δ} ) \), if \(
\textbf{A} \) and \( \textbf{δ} \) are uncorrelated, so \(
\text{var}( \textbf{δ} ) = \text{var}( \textbf{B} ) - \text{var}(
\textbf{A} ) \). Real data is not generally perfectly uncorrelated,
however: \( \text{var}(\delta) = \text{var}(B) - \text{var}(A) -
2\text{cov}(A, \delta) \). The covariance term is zero in
expectation, so estimating \( \text{var}(\delta) = \text{var}(B) -
\text{var}(A) \) is unbiased. But the \( 2\text{cov}(A, \delta) \)
is a kind of noise term, and adds variance to the estimate of \(
\text{var}( \textbf{δ} )\).</p>
<h4>3) Using Correlation</h4>
<p>It isn't obvious, but using \( \text{var}(B)(1 - \text{corr}(A, B)^2)
\) to estimate \( \text{var}( \textbf{δ} ) \) is much like using
the Difference of Variances, but with a generally smaller (but always
positive) error coming from \( \text{cov}(A, \delta) \). Proceeding
in small steps:</p>
<p>\[ \text{var}(\delta) = \text{var}(B) - \text{var}(A) - 2\text{cov}(A, \delta) \]</p>
<p>\[ \text{var}(\delta) = \text{var}(B) - \left( \text{var}(A) + 2\text{cov}(A, \delta) \right) \]</p>
<p>\[ \text{var}(\delta) = \text{var}(B) \left( 1 - \frac{\text{var}(A) + 2\text{cov}(A, \delta)}{ \text{var}(B) } \right) \]</p>
<p>\[ \text{var}(\delta) = \text{var}(B) \left( 1 - \frac{\text{var}(A)^2 + 2\text{var}(A)\text{cov}(A, \delta)}{ \text{var}(A) \text{var}(B) } \right) \]</p>
<p>This has been algebraic. Now add \( \text{cov}(A, \delta)^2 \) to
the fractional term's numerator. (This is an error in the estimate, to
get to the destination.)</p>
<p>\[ \text{var}(\delta) = \text{var}(B) \left( 1 - \frac{\text{var}(A)^2 + 2\text{var}(A)\text{cov}(A, \delta) + \text{cov}(A, \delta)^2 }{ \text{var}(A) \text{var}(B) } \right) \]</p>
<p>\[ \text{var}(\delta) = \text{var}(B) \left( 1 - \frac{ ( \text{var}(A) + \text{cov}(A, \delta))^2 }{ \text{var}(A) \text{var}(B) } \right) \]</p>
<p>The bit squared in the fraction's numerator is \( \sum{(A_i - \bar{A}
)^2} + \sum{(A_i - \bar{A} )(\delta_i - \bar{\delta})} \), which is
\( \sum{(A_i - \bar{A})(A_i - \bar{A} + \delta_i - \bar{\delta})}
\). Since \( B_i = A_i + \delta_i \) and \( \bar{B} = \bar{A} +
\bar{\delta} \), that's \( \sum{(A_i - \bar{A})(B_i - \bar{B})} \),
which is \( \text{cov}(A, B) \).</p>
<p>\[ \text{var}(\delta) = \text{var}(B) \left( 1 - \frac{ \text{cov}(A, B)^2 }{ \text{var}(A) \text{var}(B) } \right) \]</p>
<p>So at last, by definition:</p>
<p>\[ \text{var}(\delta) = \text{var}(B) \left( 1 - \text{corr}(A, B)^2 \right) \]</p>
<p>QED. The error introduced is \( \text{cov}(A, \delta)^2 /
\text{var}(A) \), which will tend to be considerably smaller in
absolute value than the \( 2\text{cov}(A, \delta) \) error in the
Difference of Variances method because \( 0 \le |\text{cov}(A,
\delta)| / \text{var}(A) \ll 2 \). This error is however positive in
expectation, so the estimate is biased: it will be slightly too small.</p>
<h3>Computational demonstration</h3>
<p>Generating 1,000 datasets where each of \( A \) and \( \delta \)
have 100 values drawn at random from Gaussians with variance 9 and 16,
respectively, the three methods above generate estimates of \(
\text{var}( \textbf{δ} ) \) as follows:</p>
<pre><code>| Method                  | Mean var(d) estimate | var(estimate) |
|-------------------------|----------------------|---------------|
| Variance of Differences |                15.98 |          5.10 |
| Difference of Variances |                15.95 |         10.69 |
| Using Correlation       |                15.82 |          5.12 |</code></pre>

<p>As expected, the method Using Correlation comes out more below the
true value of 16 on average, but its variance is comparable to that of
the Variance of Differences.</p>
<p>The bias is already small with just 100 samples, and gets smaller
still as samples get bigger and sample correlations tend to be
smaller.</p>
<p>Here's clumsy <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> code to do the experiment:</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">trials = 1000
samples = 100

set.seed(0)
est1 = c()
est2 = c()
est3 = c()

for (i in 1:trials) {
  A = rnorm(samples, sd=3)  # var=9
  d = rnorm(samples, sd=4)  # var=16
  B = A + d  # var=25, in population sense
  est1 = c(est1, var(B - A))  # same as var(d)
  est2 = c(est2, var(B) - var(A))
  est3 = c(est3, var(B) * (1 - cor(A, B)^2))
}

mean(est1)
## [1] 15.98799
mean(est2)
## [1] 15.9451
mean(est3)
## [1] 15.82234
var(est1)
## [1] 5.09602
var(est2)
## [1] 10.69393
var(est3)
## [1] 5.117983</code></pre>

<title>Practical Data Science with Python, by George</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>Packt sent me a copy of this <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/product/practical-data-science-with-python/9781801071970">book</a> to review. It's 621 pages with
the best and worst characteristics of a typical data science boot
camp: very broad, necessarily shallow, frequently not quite perfect.
Even an imperfect map can tell you a lot about the territory, and it
could be the right book for you.</p>
<p>George has pulled together a lot of material, some of it good. He
includes introductory Python and command line, enough SQL to be
confused about SQL, examples with Bitcoin prices, an idiosyncratic
survey of visualization, web scraping, statistics, and the big machine
learning models, including the <a href="/20211003-xgboost_lightgbm_catboost_briefly/">big three boosted tree algorithms</a>,
which I appreciate. He includes some NLP, and even some on ethics.</p>
<p>George's own list of omissions (page 571) illustrates what he thinks
is almost in scope:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recommender systems</li>
<li>Networks and graph analysis</li>
<li>Machine learning explainability</li>
<li>Test-driven development (TDD)</li>
<li>Reinforcement learning</li>
<li>Neural networks</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe the moral is that “data science” is too big a topic for one
book. Trying to pack so much in has a cost. Here's the complete
section on “Paired t- and z-tests”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One last type of t- or z-test is the paired test. This is for paired
samples, like before-and-after treatments. For example, we could
measure the blood pressure of people before and after taking a
medication to see if there is an effect. A function that can be used
for this is <code>scipy.stats.ttest_rel</code>, which can be used like this:</p>
<p><code>scipy.stats.ttest_rel(before, after)</code></p>
<p>This will return a t-statistic and p-value like with other <code>scipy</code>
t-test functions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you've never heard of a paired t-test before, it's great this book
tells you about it. You can start to ask questions like: Why is this a
separate test? Does it have some advantage over a regular t-test?
Hopefully you also question some parts of the book, as when Bayesian
methods are dismissed as “much more complex to implement than a
t-test.”</p>
<p>This is a map that can point you in a lot of interesting directions,
which is valuable!</p>
