<title>Trekonomics, by Saadia</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>This is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trekonomics">best book</a> on Star Trek economics that I've read
(sorry, <a href="/20201109-economics_of_star_trek_by_webb/" title="The Economics of Star Trek, by Webb">Webb</a>). Personal, erudite, and optimistic, <a href="https://www.inkshares.com/books/trekonomics">it</a> suggests
that post-scarcity has started, and that while there's still a long
way to go, we can work merrily to advance farther.</p>
<p><img alt="cover" src="cover.jpg"></p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is almost a paradox to state it this way, but in a society where
nothing is scarce and consequently where work is no longer a
prerequisite for survival, finding good reasons to work becomes
paramount, the defining existential question that everyone has to
ask themselves." (pages 44-45)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"For those who can't swing it, the imperative to build a meaningful
life through work becomes a source of unbearable anxiety." (page 58)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RepRap_project">RepRap project</a> to make a 3D printer that can print copies of
itself is pretty neat!</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"As with most open-source projects, what is learned and invented
along the way is as valuable as the stated goal." (page 79)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFM_International_LEAP">LEAP</a> stands for "Leading Edge Aviation Propulsion."</p>
<hr>
<p>On page 86 he mentions "Pareto improvement" which refers to a change
that helps something and hurts nothing else, which is a neat idea from
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency">Pareto efficiency</a> (not to be confused with the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">Pareto principle</a>). I think a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic">ROC curve</a> should represent a
Pareto frontier...</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Empirical data suggests that given enough time, all rival goods are
either substituted or become nonrival." (page 100)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>The emphasis on reputation as a motivator is interesting. Thinking of
modern social media, which is a kind of focus on reputation, it seems
like a system with risks. It matters whose opinion you value. If you
spend all your time on public reputation management and none on quiet
work, for example, reputation may be a distraction rather than a
focusing agent.</p>
<hr>
<p>There's some fairly naive exponential extrapolation of economic
productivity to the 24th century... Seems like some discussion of
exponential vs. sigmoid might be appropriate...</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Our culture hungers for the cheap thrills of apocalypse." (page
106)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"News of our imminent demise has been greatly exaggerated." (page
107)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elinor_Ostrom">Elinor Ostrom</a>, <em>Governing the Commons: The Evolution of
Institutions for Collective Action</em> (Cambridge: Cambridge University
Press, 1990), p. 183. It is hands-down one of the most important
books of the past fifty years."</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Without rules or regulations, be they self-imposed or enforced by
an external intrumentality (an agency or a government),
overconsumption is almost always guaranteed. Such rules and
regulations are extremely hard to devise, and enforcement is very
complex." (page 121)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Thanks to science and political activism, we mustered the power to
ban lead in domestic products. However, the public health
consequences and the costs borne by society were enormous (including
but not limited to widespread disruption of prefrontal cortex
development in children, leading to significant increases in violent
crime). We let oil and car companies free ride on the back of
society. It would have taken much longer to ban lead had it not been
for the heroic work of Caltech geochemist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clair_Cameron_Patterson">Clair Patterson</a>."
(page 122)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Free riding takes place at a myriad of points in the overall
system, from individuals to corporations to states. Many private
economic actors routinely engage in various forms of legal and
illegal tax evasion, weakening the very same public institutions
that help and guarantee their business. This is free riding, but on
government. The usual self-servicing argument that everybody does it
anyway does not make the practice any less craven or repellent. The
managers and stockholders of these multinational corporations are
perfectly aware that they are breaching the contract between their
companies and society as a whole. Basically, they behave no better
than Third World dictators who stuff stolen cash in Swiss vaults.
Only a residual sense of guilt about the extent of their free riding
makes them publicize their paltry philanthropic efforts and their
so-called corporate-citizenship initiatives. They operate with the
dread of getting caught, and thus aggressively support political
parties, economists, and opinion makers who agitate against taxes
out of naive philosophical principles. The perverse result is that
all too often and in too many countries, the party of the free
market, which in truth should defend open society, progress, and
civic spirit, ends up as the party of tax evasion, monopoly, and
free riding." (page 124)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Saadia recommends <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalker_(1979_film)">Stalker</a>, which is based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roadside_Picnic">Roadside Picnic</a>.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dispossessed"><em>The Dispossessed</em></a> specifically makes the case that
post-scarcity is not so much a matter of material wealth or natural
bounty, but an organizational option for society." (page 143)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"By the time <em>Next Generation</em> rolls around, the conflict between
the messy present and the aspirational future has been resolved.
Stoicism has won. The <em>Enterprise</em>'s new crew is all Spock and no
Kirk." (page 172)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Even more pointedly, if we take a step back from Hollywood's
romance of space travel, with its gizmos and its aliens, we may soon
come to the rather disquieting realization that we <em>already</em> live in
Keynes's, and therefore <em>Star Trek</em>'s, cornucopia. Economic bliss is
just very unevenly distributed, to paraphrase science-fiction author
William Gibson." (page 211)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"If you believe that <em>Star Trek</em> is about space travel, you are
taking it too literally." (page 215)</p>

that matters is as good as free to many of us. When allocation
decisions consist in choosing between your new iPhone

have whittled down your ninety-nine problems to the last few
marginal ones. For all intents and purposes, and save for a few
minor imperfections, the global economy already acts as one massive
replicator." (page 232)</p>

<title>Software Engineering at Google</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>I read <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/software-engineering-at/9781492082781/">this</a> over half a year with a book club of colleagues at
work, one chapter per week, which is part of why I have such a lot of
notes below. Interesting stuff! Even when it isn't perfectly
applicable to my own work, it's neat to peek a little bit inside the
giant company.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1: <a href="#ch1" name="ch1">What is Software Engineering?</a></h3>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"It's <em>programming</em> if 'clever' is a compliment, but it's <em>software
engineering</em> if 'clever' is an accusation." (page 10)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A colleague notes: "I don&#8217;t even think clever in programming should be
a compliment most times. Elegance deserves a compliment, though."</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"... the goal is consensus, not unanimity." (page 18)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I haven't thought about it much before, but if consensus isn't
unanimity, it's hard to define.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Efficiency gains from keeping engineers happy, focused, and engaged
can easily dominate other factors, simply because focus and
productivity are so variable, and a 10-to-20% difference is easy to
imagine." (pages 18-19)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"We often say, "Google is a data-driven culture." In fact, that's a
simplification: even when there isn't <em>data</em>, there might still be
<em>evidence</em>, <em>precedent</em>, and <em>argument</em>." (page 19)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, page 24 adds "<em>assumption</em>."</p>
<hr>
<p>Discussion of whether to use an existing thing, fork it to modify it,
or build your own, on page 22...</p>
<hr>
<h3>Chapter 2: <a href="#ch2" name="ch2">How to Work Well on Teams</a></h3>
<p>This chapter is largely a short version of <a href="/20151118-debugging_teams/">Debugging Teams</a> by the
same author, which is very welcome.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Many humans have the instinct to find and worship idols." (page 28)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Genius Myth is the tendency that we as humans need to ascribe
the success of a team to a single person/leader." (page 28)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"The vast majority of the work at Google (and at most companies!)
doesn't require genius-level intellect, but 100% of the work
requires a minimal level of social skills." (page 29)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Hopefully most engineers recognize that it is better to be one part
of a successful project than the critical part of a failed project."
(page 31)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"We think the middle ground
[between individual offices and open floor plans] is really the best
solution. Group teams of four to eight people together in small
rooms (or large offices) to make it easy (and non-embarrassing) for
spontaneous conversation to happen." (page 33)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is similar to advice in <a href="/20200523-peopleware_productive_projects_and_teams/">Peopleware</a>.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"If less-knowledgeable [or, really, any] people on your team feel
that there's a barrier to asking you a question, it's a problem:
finding the right balance is an art." (page 33)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h3>Chapter 3: <a href="#ch3" name="ch3">Knowledge Sharing</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>The problem of "all-or-nothing expertise" (page 44)</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Tribal and written knowledge complement each other." (page 46)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>They reference <a href="https://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/five-keys-to-a-successful-google-team/">The five keys to a successful Google team
</a>, which are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Psychological safety: Can we take risks on this team without
   feeling insecure or embarrassed?</li>
<li>Dependability: Can we count on each other to do high quality work
   on time?</li>
<li>Structure &amp; clarity: Are goals, roles, and execution plans on our
   team clear?</li>
<li>Meaning of work: Are we working on something that is personally
   important for each of us?</li>
<li>Impact of work: Do we fundamentally believe that the work we&#8217;re
   doing matters?</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"... Moma, Google's intranet search engine." (page 51)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"YAQS ("Yet Another Question System") is a Google-internal version
of a Stack Overflow-like website" (page 52)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>a Google-internal version of a Stack Overflow-like website</p>
<hr>
<p>g3doc is pretty neat. Described more in: <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon16europe/program/presentation/macnamara">The Knowledge: Towards a Culture of Engineering Documentation</a></p>
<hr>
<p>https://codelabs.developers.google.com/</p>
<hr>
<p>This stuff on readability is interesting, since the Google meaning of
readability is not the same as the usual meaning of readability. It
helps me better understand such <a href="https://tilde.news/s/zghf2x/what_are_all_jeff_dean_facts">Jeff Dean facts</a> as:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Jeff Dean once bit a spider, the spider got super powers and C++
   readability."</li>
<li>"Jeff Dean has punch card readability."</li>
<li>"Jeff Dean has binary readability."</li>
<li>"Jeff Dean acquired Sawzall readability after writing 58 lines of
   Sawzall code. As part of his readability review, he pointed out a
   flaw in the style guide which was promptly corrected by the
   reviewer."</li>
<li>"Jeff got Java readability with only 8 lines of code."</li>
<li>"Jeff Dean has Perl Readability. (TRUE)"</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Engelbart's <a href="https://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/115/000/">Bootstrapping Organizations Into the 21st Century</a> is
largely about knowledge sharing.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Chapter 4: <a href="#ch4" name="ch4">Engineering for Equity</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>In discussing "technology to scan, capture, and identify people
walking down the street" (page 73) it kind of highlights how fraught
discussions of ethics are: Is the problem "racial variance in facial
recognition" or is the problem doing facial recognition <em>at all</em>?</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Google now offers statistical training within the context of AI to
help ensure that datasets are not intrinsically biased." (page 74)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I asked for more info: https://twitter.com/planarrowspace/status/1317130678643941379</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Ratings, although an important way to measure performance during a
specific period, are not predictive of future performance and should
not be used to gauge readiness for a future role or qualify an
internal candidate for a different team." (page 77)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h3>Chapter 5: <a href="#ch5" name="ch5">How to Lead a Team</a></h3>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"A <em>Manager</em> is a leader of people, whereas a <em>Tech Lead</em> leads
technology efforts." (page 81)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both of these (and the <em>Tech Lead Manager</em>, when one person does both
roles) seem to be tied to a team (in contrast to "matrix" style).</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Most TLs are also individual contributors, which often forces them
to choose between doing something quickly themselves or delegating
it to a team member to do (sometimes) more slowly." (page 82)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><a href="https://takeout.google.com/">Google Takeout</a> is a public-facing tool
(also?) now. (page 83)</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Before the computing age, "management" and "labor" might have taken
on almost antagonistic roles, with the manager wielding all of the
power and labor requiring collective action to achieve its own ends.
But that isn't how modern software companies work." (page 86)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This seems... incomplete.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Traditional managers worry about how to get things done, whereas
great managers worry about what things get done (and trust their
team to figure out how to do it)." (page 87)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"If your employees are so uninterested in their job that they
actually need traditional-manager babysitting to be convinced to
work, <em>that</em> is your real problem."</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"[with low performers] It almost always requires temporary
micromanagement, ..." (page 90)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>On page 95, the emphasis on asking questions (rather than giving
direct advice, etc.) is a good reminder.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Chapter 6: <a href="#ch6" name="ch6">Leading at Scale</a></h3>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>Always Be Deciding<ul>
<li>Identify blinders</li>
<li>Identify trade-offs</li>
<li>Decide</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Always Be Leaving<ul>
<li>Build a "self-driving" team</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Always Be Scaling<ul>
<li>Important versus urgent</li>
<li>Learn to drop balls</li>
<li>Protecting your energy</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"... if you agree that your mission is to build a self-driving
organization, the main mechanism of teaching is through delegation."
(page 113)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"You give them an assignment, let them fail, and then try again and
again." (page 113)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"One technique for fighting the feeling that you don't know what
you're doing is to simply pretend that <em>some</em> expert out there knows
exactly what to do, and that they're simply on vacation and you're
temporarily subbing in for them. It's a great way to remove the
personal stakes and give yourself permission to fail and learn."
(page 116)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"... over time, as you grow older, your overall stamina builds up.
Early in your career, working eight hours a day in an office can
feel like a shock; you come home tired and dazed. But just like
training for a marathon, your brain and body build up larger
reserves of stamina over time." (page 120)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Your brain operates in natural 90-minute cycles." (page 121)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They reference <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_rest%E2%80%93activity_cycle">BRAC</a> (Basic Rest-Activity Cycle)... I'm not sure
how much formal research evidence there really is, but I'm still down
with taking breaks every once in a while.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Chapter 7: <a href="#ch7" name="ch7">Measuring Engineering Productivity</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>The "Triage: Is It Even Worth Measuring?" section starting page 125
reminds me of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassie_Kozyrkov">Cassie Kozyrkov</a>'s "decision science" stuff, focusing
on statistics for decision-making.</p>
<hr>
<p>On page 127 they imagine "there's a major funding deadline
approaching" which makes me wonder what this means inside Google. How
is funding determined?</p>
<hr>
<p>On page 129 they start talking about Goals/Signals/Metrics (GSM). They
identify QUANTS categories (Quality of the code, Attention from
engineers, Intellectual complexity, Tempo and velocity, Satisfaction).
It seems like this is related to the <a href="https://www.productplan.com/glossary/heart-framework/">HEART framework</a> (Happiness,
Engagement, Adoption, Retention, Task success) which also uses GSM.</p>
<hr>
<p>Page 129 also references Dijkstra's
<a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD10xx/EWD1036.html">On the cruelty of really teaching computing science</a> in a footnote.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Although academic literature has proposed many proxies for code
quality, none of them have truly captured it. For readability, we
had a decision of either using a poor proxy and possibly making a
decision based on it, or simply acknowledging that this is a point
that cannot currently be measured. Ultimately, we decided not to
capture this as a quantitative measure, though we did ask engineers
to self-rate their code quality." (page 133)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"It has routinely been our experience at Google that when the
quantitative and qualitative metrics disagree, it was because the
quantitative metrics were not capturing the expected result." (page
133)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"There is a temptation to use such metrics to evaluate individual
engineers, or perhaps even to identify high and low performers.
Doing so would be counterproductive, though. If productivity metrics
are used for performance reviews, engineers will be quick to game
the metrics, and they will no longer be useful for measuring and
improving productivity across the organization. The only way to make
these measurements work is to let go of the idea of measuring
individuals and embrace measuring the aggregate effect." (page 134)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Qualitative metrics should also align with the quantitative
metrics; if they do not, it is likely the quantitative metrics that
are incorrect." (page 138)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h3>Chapter 8: <a href="#ch8" name="ch8">Style Guides and Rules</a></h3>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"... our C++ rules disallow use of exceptions, a language feature
widely used outside of Google code." (page 142)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"SREs, library engineers, and code janitors" (page 147)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I didn't know Google used the term "code janitor"... I found at least
one <a href="https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/37755.pdf">ref</a> that also uses "janitors."</p>
<hr>
<p>Page 149 mentions <a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/starlark">Starlark</a>, which I don't think I'd heard of
before.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"We place higher value on simplified, straightforward code that is
easier to understand and maintain." (page 150)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"... multiple inheritance, something explicitly forbidden for all
other C++ code." (page 151)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>I used to like the NumPy comment guidelines, but these days I prefer
the Google <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide#38-comments-and-docstrings">ones</a> mentioned on page 152.</p>
<hr>
<p>I hadn't realized that Google had their own Python autoformatter, as
mentioned on page 161. Seems like <a href="https://github.com/google/yapf">yapf</a> is very similar to
<a href="https://github.com/psf/black">black</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Chapter 9: <a href="#ch9" name="ch9">Code Review</a></h3>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;At Google, reviewers may even directly share suggested edits with
an author within the code review tool itself.&#8221; (page 503)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>GitLab does this, but only for single-line changes, as far as I
know...</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;After you check that piece of code into the codebase, it is no
longer yours in any case.&#8221; (page 507)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Probably the most important practice to keep the code review
process nimble is to keep changes small.&#8221; (page 509)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;A change description should indicate its type of change on the
first line, as a summary. The first line is prime real estate and is
used to provide summaries within the code review tool itself, to act
as the subject line in any associated emails, and to become the
visible line Google engineers see in a history summary within Code
Search (see Chapter&#160;17), so that first line is important.&#8221; (page
512)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Keep Reviewers to a Minimum" (page 514)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h3>Chapter 10: <a href="#ch10" name="ch10">Documentation</a></h3>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;At Google, our most successful efforts have been when documentation
is treated like code and incorporated into the traditional

<p>&#8220;Most teams at Google require an approved design document before
starting work on any major project. A software engineer typically
writes the proposed design document using a specific design doc
template approved by the team. Such documents are designed to be
collaborative, so they are often shared in Google Docs, which has
good collaboration tools. Some teams require such design documents
to be discussed and debated at specific team meetings, where the
finer points of the design can be discussed or critiqued by experts.
In some respects, these design discussions act as a form of code
review before any code is written.&#8221; (page 560)</p>

hasn&#8217;t been touched in, for example, three months. Such freshness
dates, as shown in the following example&#8212;and tracking your documents
as bugs&#8212;can help make a documentation set easier to maintain over

<h3>Chapter 13: <a href="#ch13" name="ch13">Test Doubles</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>The tl;dr on page 280 is a pretty good summary:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A real implementation should be preferred over a test double.</li>
<li>A fake is often the ideal solution if a real implementation can't
  be used in a test.</li>
<li>Overuse of stubbing leads to tests that are unclear and brittle.</li>
<li>Interaction testing should be avoided when possible: it leads to
  tests that are brittle because it exposes implementation details
  of the system under test.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"[Tests using mocking frameworks] required constant effort to
maintain while rarely finding bugs." (page 259)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>They talk about dependency injection, which I think is generally a
good idea, especially if you can separate in the style of "functional
shell, imperative core" so that you're testing mostly pure functions.</p>
<p>I hadn't known about "automated dependency injection frameworks" -
maybe they're neat?</p>
<ul>
<li>https://github.com/google/guice</li>
<li>https://github.com/google/dagger</li>
</ul>
<p>Are there any for Python? At least one:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://python-dependency-injector.ets-labs.org/</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm not sure I want to use it... It seems mostly for very
object-oriented designs, though I could be wrong.</p>
<p>The book also says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"With dynamically typed languages such as Python or JavaScript, it
is possible to dynamically replace individual functions or object
methods. Dependency injection is less important in these languages
because this capability makes it possible to use real
implementations of dependencies in tests while only overriding
functions or methods of the dependency that are unsuitable for
tests." (page 261)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I mean, I guess so, but I don't love that style either.</p>
<p>I agree more with this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Code written without testing in mind typically needs to be
refactored or rewritten before you can add appropriate tests." (page
261)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Techniques for using test doubles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Faking: A parallel implementation stands in</li>
<li>Stubbing: Force something to return a specific value</li>
<li>Interaction testing: Check that something <em>was</em> called (don't
   actually call it)</li>
</ul>
<p>But: Prefer real implementations ("classical testing")</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Stubbing leaks implementation details of your code into your test."
(page 273)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Another downside of interaction testing is that it utilizes
implementation details of the system under test" (page 276)</p>

<h3>Chapter 14: <a href="#ch14" name="ch14">Larger Testing</a></h3>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"At Google, configuration changes are the number one reason for our
major outages." (page 284)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Without clear ownership, a test rots." (page 285)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>On page 286 they mention "C/J Build" as Google's "first continuous
build framework" and TAP as its replacement. Mike Bland has an
interesting <a href="https://mike-bland.com/2012/06/21/chris-jay-continuous-build.html">history</a> of the "Chris/Jay continuous build" and the
"Test Automation Platform."</p>
<hr>
<p>On page 289, I think they may have their math wrong. They say two 10%
inaccurate things have a combined likelihood of a bug of 99% (1 -
(0.1 * 0.1)). I think they're trying to do one minus the probability
of no bugs, which should be (1 - (0.9 * 0.9)), or 19%. That's higher
than 10%, but it isn't as bad as 99%. I'm not sure what they intended
here.</p>
<hr>
<p>They advocate "record/replay proxies" as a testing technique, rather
than faking things out more completely, in contrast with
<a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/consumerDrivenContracts.html">consumer-driven contracts</a>. They point to some <a href="https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-go/blob/master/rpcreplay/doc.go">Go source</a> (with
comments) for <code>rpcreplay</code>.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>

<p>I thought 20% time was supposed to be more fun than that.</p>
<hr>
<p>There isn't an obvious deprecation system in Python, as far as I know.
There is a built-in <code>DeprecationWarning</code>. There is a <a href="https://pypi.org/project/deprecation/">package</a> but
you have to install it. If you already have TensorFlow installed, you
can use <code>tensorflow.contrib.framework.deprecated</code> from it (in TF
1.14.0).</p>
<hr>
<h3>Chapter 16: <a href="#ch16" name="ch16">Version Control and Branch Management</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>The chapter is by Titus Winters, and he refers to what Google does as
"trunk-based development." I think he also likes to say "live at head"
to mean largely the same thing. He references <a href="https://www.devops-research.com/research.html" title="DevOps Research and Assessment organization">DORA</a>, who agrees,
and was aquired by Google.</p>
<hr>
<p>I was reminded of the bad old days at a previous employer, where for
some code we couldn't version control we would pass around a big green
translucent serving platter to represent "having a lock" on the code.</p>
<hr>
<p>A commit is like an instantaneous lock/edit/unlock.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"... considering common <em>usage</em>, both the centralized and DVCS
[Distributed Version Control System] models are largely
interchangeable:" (page 333)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Hard to not want to nit-pick the focus on time (cf. Time, Clocks, and
the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System) and think of Git's
time-free approach. Apparently Google's versions are incrementing
integers?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Monotonically increasing version numbers, rather than commit
hashes, are particularly troublesome. Many systems and scripts have
grown up in the Google developer ecosystem that assume that the
numeric ordering of commits is the same as the temporal
order&#8211;undoing those hidden dependencies is difficult." (page 333)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Google's main version control system, for the giant monorepo, is
called Piper. I think I saw somewhere that it used to be Perforce?</p>
<hr>
<pre><code>Abseil : C++ :: Guava : Java</code></pre>

<hr>
<p>Seems like Java "shading" is (a little bit) like Python's dunderscore
mangling, but specifically for dependencies. Google hates dependency
conflicts.</p>
<hr>
<p>On page 343 they reference <a href="https://itrevolution.com/book/the-phoenix-project">The Phoenix Project</a>: A Novel About IT,
DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win. Apparently it advocates
"reducing work-in-progress" among other things.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Our various teams have all sorts of policies about release branches

release cadence promised by CD [Continuous Delivery] that obviates
the need or desire for a release branch." (page 344)</p>

<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Long-lived dev branches are not a good default plan." (page 349)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Agree.</p>
<hr>
<p>They really advocate "for interrepository dependencies to be
unpinned/"at head"/"trunk based."" I think this must make sense when
you're running a ton of interdependent things. Most of my work is on
quite independent projects, like a statistical analysis that can run
with its own universe of dependencies that never need to be aligned
with any other repo's dependencies. For my stuff, pinning dependencies
pretty aggressively is good for reproducibility.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Chapter 17: <a href="#ch17" name="ch17">Code Search</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>The old "external Code Search" is described <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Code_Search">on Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<p>Hmm! There is some <a href="https://developers.google.com/code-search">public Google code search</a>, not mentioned in the
text. It... doesn't seem great? But maybe I don't know what to look
for.</p>
<p>Hmm! Google's <code>RE2</code> regular expression engine is <a href="https://github.com/google/re2">open source</a> and
has a <a href="https://pypi.org/project/google-re2/">Python wrapper</a>. Looks like the trade-off is speed in
exchange for "various PCRE features (e.g. backreferences, look-around
assertions) are not supported".</p>
<hr>
<p>Ah! I thought so! Yegge was behind <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Kythe#Grok">Grok</a>, which became/merged with
<a href="https://kythe.io/">Kythe</a>, which knows all about programming.</p>
<hr>
<p>One page 353 they advocate "using named types rather than generic
things like strings or integers, because it's then easy to find all
usages." Okay.</p>
<hr>
<p>On page 354 they mention "how to compute a fingerprint for integer
values efficiently" and I think that could be referring to getting the
hash of something; are they talking about hashing integers? Are these
integers so big that they can't just be their own hashes? Or is that
cheating?</p>
<hr>
<p>On page 357 there's a screenshot of a log viewer that seems to be
called "Analog" but I think it's different from the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_(program)">web log analyzer</a> of that name...</p>
<hr>
<p>They have a <a href="https://github.com/Tendrl/documentation/wiki/Best-Practices-for-Response-Times-and-Latency">surprising reference</a> for the "responsive if latencies
are below 200 ms" bit on page 359.</p>
<hr>
<p>The code for the <a href="https://github.com/google/codesearch">old internal Google code search</a> is up, and also
you can read <a href="https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp4.html">Russ Cox</a> explaining it. Trigrams!</p>
<hr>
<p>The reference to searching 20GB/s is now <a href="https://www.scalyr.com/blog/searching-1tb-sec-systems-engineering-before-algorithms/">searching 1.5TB/s</a>!</p>
<p>Had to go Wayback, but there's also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190830155843/volnitsky.com/project/str_search">a bunch on substring matching</a>.</p>
<hr>

<li>trigram</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffix_array">suffix array</a></li>
<li>token-based sparse n-gram (uses Google's "primary indexing and search stack")</li>
</ul>
<p>They describe moving the inverted index from memory to flash storage,
which I guess probably isn't relevant to the current state.</p>
<hr>
<p>On page 369 they mention "low recall accuracy" and go on to say that
means "nonmatches need to be filtered out of the result set." I think
they're using "recall accuracy" to mean "precision"?</p>
<hr>
<h3>Chapter 18: <a href="#ch18" name="ch18">Build Systems and Build Philosophy</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>Did they seriously just have a whole chapter on build systems and not
mention <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)">make</a>? They mention "Ant, Maven, Gradle, Grunt, and Rake"
(page 376) but can't mention <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)">make</a>?</p>
<hr>
<p>There's some disconnect between their "engineers love the build
system" and the footnote that says "83% of Googlers reported being
satisfied with the build system" (page 371).</p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>Google's internal "Blaze" build tool<ul>
<li><a href="https://buck.build/">Buck</a>, a Facebook tool apparently inspired by Blaze</li>
<li><a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/">Pants</a>, a tool inspired by Blaze</li>
<li><a href="https://bazel.build/">Bazel</a>, the open source Blaze</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>They point out that the artifact-based input/output structure of Bazel
is analogous to functional programming. That's true. In this way,
Bazel is similar to lots of DAG-based systems, like <a href="https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/index.html">Airflow</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/ajschumacher/ajschumacher.github.io/issues/86">etc.</a></p>
<hr>
<p>They mention C++ can include other files and that this is an issue for
knowing what's changed, but I didn't see that they described Bazel
having a solution for this...</p>
<hr>
<p>They mention "the 1:1:1 rule" on page 391 but don't really explain it.
Finding an <a href="https://v1.pantsbuild.org/build_files.html">old version</a> of their link:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The idiom of having one target per directory, representing a single
package, is sometimes referred to as the 1:1:1 rule."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So that's 1 directory, 1 target, 1 package.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"<a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle">Gazelle</a> is a Bazel build file generator for Bazel projects. It
natively supports Go and protobuf, and it may be extended to support
new languages and custom rule sets."</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Automatically managed dependencies
["*", "+", "&gt;" in version specifications] can be convenient for
small projects, but they're usually a recipe for disaster on
projects of nontrivial size or that are being worked on by more than
one engineer." (page 394)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"... we enforce a strict <a href="https://opensource.google/docs/thirdparty/oneversion/"><em>One-Version Rule</em></a> for all third-party
dependencies in our internal codebase." (page 394)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>A thought I had in connection with all this monorepo stuff is: Is this
part of the motivation for microservices? A microservice can (in
theory?) just expose an API but otherwise have an isolated codebase,
OS, etc. It seems like Google jumps through a lot of hoops and
introduces a lot of coordination in order to make the monorepo work...</p>
<hr>
<p>The advice (page 396) to mirror external dependencies so you don't
depend on somebody continuing to host them the same way is pretty good
advice. (Continues to use Docker Hub base images etc...)</p>
<hr>
<h3>Chapter 19: <a href="#ch19" name="ch19">Critique: Google's Code Review Tool</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>On page 400 they reference Google's "web-based code editing tool". On
page 406 it's "Cider, an online IDE for editing source code stored in
the cloud". I don't see much about it online, but there is this fun
<a href="https://github.com/jhuangtw/xg2xg">table</a> showing Google-internal things and how they map to
non-Google things.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"In emergency cases, the author can forcefully commit their changes
and have it reviewed after commit." (page 402)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice to have in a pinch; could allow abuse but still.</p>
<hr>
<p>They mention on page 403 that their diff does move detection, which
many diff tools don't do terribly well... I wonder if theirs is much
better.</p>
<hr>
<p>I saw somebody online who likes Critique and they said
https://reviewable.io/ is the closest publicly available tool...</p>
<hr>
<p>Apparently Critique does screenshot diffs of UIs generated by code,
which is neat. (page 404)</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"When users drill down to the file level, Critique provides a UI
widget with a compact display of the chain of snapshot versions of a
file;" (page 404)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>This "Zapfhahn" test coverage tool seemed to be mentioned (page 406)
only in this book, outside of Google... Similarly for the "GwsQ" for
passing code review to someone in a list automatically.</p>
<hr>
<p>I like this behavior of Critique:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"As mentioned earlier, comments are drafted as-you-go, but then
"published" atomically, as shown in Figure 19-7. This allows authors
and reviewers to ensure that they are happy with their comments
before sending them out." (page 409)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>On page 414 they say "each commit is reviewed separately" but I think
they must mean each "change set" or branch (in the case of git)...</p>
<hr>
<h3>Chapter 20: <a href="#ch20" name="ch20">Static Analysis</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>Google's static analysis system: <a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub43322/" title="Tricorder: Building a Program Analysis Ecosystem">Tricorder</a></p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Static analysis tools at Google must scale to the size of Google's
multibillion-line codebase. To do this, analysis tools are shardable
and incremental. Instead of analyzing entire large projects, we
focus analyses on files affected by a pending code change, and
typically show analysis results only for edited files or lines."
(page 418)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is different from most usages of "scaling" that I've seen. "We
scale by not trying to scale." I mean, I guess it is a kind of
scaling?</p>
<p>Also on page 423, they make it sound like analysis is always
single-function (not involving more of the codebase).</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Research about static analysis tools traditionally focused on
reducing false negatives; in practice, low false-positive rates are
often critical for developers to actually want to use a tool&#8211;who
wants to wade through hundreds of false reports in search of a few
true ones?" (page 419-420)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"An issue is an "effective false positive" if developers did not
take some positive action after seeing the issue." (page 420)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>On page 421 they mention <a href="https://github.com/google/Refaster">Refaster</a>, which has been eaten by
<a href="https://errorprone.info/">Error Prone</a>.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Seven of these [more than 100] analyzers are themselves plug-in
systems that have hundreds of additional checks, again contributed
from developers across Google." (page 422)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hadn't thought of this before! How crazy: My plug-in has plug-ins!</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"before we established clear feedback channels, many developers
would just ignore analysis results they did not understand." (page
423)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Instead of reenabling customizability, we asked users why they were

linters. For example, the C++ linter also ran on Objective-C files
but produced incorrect, useless results. ... In short, user
customization resulted in hidden bugs and suppressing feedback."

<p>It does kind of seem like a lot of Google's pain with regard to

<title>How to Make the World Add Up, by Harford</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>Looks like I got the <a href="https://timharford.com/books/worldaddup/">UK edition</a> rather than the <a href="https://timharford.com/books/datadetective/">US edition</a> (US
title: "The Data Detective"). Ties to audio are evident, from frequent
citations of podcasts to the titling and overall style. Probably good
as an audiobook too. I liked it a lot. Plenty of good examples and a
humane focus on aspects of understanding data that are too often
neglected.</p>
<h3>&#8220;Ten Rules for Thinking Differently About Numbers&#8221; (rules re-worded)</h3>
<ol>
<li><a href="#ch1">Be aware of your emotions.</a></li>
<li><a href="#ch2">Consider both first-person experience and statistical views.</a></li>
<li><a href="#ch3">Understand what definitions really mean.</a></li>
<li><a href="#ch4">Put things in appropriate context.</a></li>
<li><a href="#ch5">Be aware of publication bias and significance testing generally.</a></li>
<li><a href="#ch6">Consider what's missing (especially as a result of bias).</a></li>
<li><a href="#ch7">Overfitting can happen; models may be bad; demand transparency.</a></li>
<li><a href="#ch8">Value good official statistics.</a></li>
<li><a href="#ch9">Be skeptical of visualizations.</a></li>
<li><a href="#ch10">Keep an open mind.</a></li>
</ol>
<p>And the Golden rule: <a href="#golden">Be curious</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"I worry about a world in which many people will believe anything,
but I worry far more about one in which people believe nothing
beyond their own preconceptions." (page 15)</p>

<p>He references <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Lie_with_Statistics">How to Lie With Statistics</a> but laments the
associated cynicism.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Chapter 1: <a href="#ch1" name="ch1">Be aware of your emotions.</a></h3>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sometimes, we want to be fooled." (page 23)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"All the statistical expertise in the world will not prevent you
believing claims you shouldn't believe and dismissing facts you
shouldn't dismiss." (page 23)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"One survey of gay and bisexual men in the United States found that
almost half believed HIV did not cause AIDS and more than half
believed the standard treatments did more harm than good." (page 29)</p>

</ul>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"If doubt is the weapon, detail is the ammunition." (page 37)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interesting comparison: "Must I believe this?" vs. "Can I believe
this?" With more detail, there are more things to find fault with, and
also more things to find convincing.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"We can learn to control our emotions&#8212;that is part of the process of
growing up." (page 42)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h3>Chapter 2: <a href="#ch2" name="ch2">Consider both first-person experience and statistical views.</a></h3>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sometimes personal experience tells us one thing, the statistics
tell us something quite different, and both are true." (page 54)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Though a factor of sixteen is hardly a small effect, lung cancer is
itself scarce enough to confuse our intuitions. The world is full of
patterns that are too subtle or too rare to detect by eyeballing
them, and a pattern doesn't need to be very subtle or rare to be
hard to spot without a statistical lens." (page 54)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"<a href="https://youarenotsosmart.com/2017/07/20/yanss-101-naive-realism-rebroadcast/">Naive realism</a> can lead us badly astray when we confuse our
personal perspective on the world with some universal truth. We are
surprised when an election goes against us: everyone in our social
circle agreed with us, so why did the nation vote otherwise? Opinion
polls don't always get it right, but I can assure you they have a
better track record of predicting elections that simply talking to
your friends." (page 57)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Na%C3%AFve_realism_(psychology)">naive realism thing</a> is interesting. I think it's
fundamentally the assumption that other people are basically the same
as us except for what they've experienced, so if only they saw that
article in The Atlantic, then we'd agree?</p>

<p>"These news reports are data, in a way. They're just not

</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Social scientists have long understood that statistical metrics are
at their most pernicious when they are being used to control the
world, rather than try to understand it. Economists tend to cite
their colleague Charles Goodhart, who wrote in 1975: 'Any observed
statistical regularity will tend to collapse once pressure is placed
upon it for control purposes.' (Or, more pithily: 'When a measure
becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.') Psychologists
turn to Donald T. Campbell, who around the same time explained: 'The
more any quantitative social indicator is used for social
decision-making, the more subject it will be to corruption pressures
and the more apt it will be to distort and corrupt the social
processes it is intended to monitor.'" (page 62)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Citations from page 299:</p>

<p>"Muhammad Yunus, an economist, microfinance pioneer and winner of
the Nobel Peace Prize, has contrasted the 'worm's eye view' of

Professor Yunus is right to emphasize the advantage of seeing it up
close." (page 64)</p>

<h3>Chapter 3: <a href="#ch3" name="ch3">Understand what definitions really mean.</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>Around page 70, interesting stuff on differences in infant mortality
rates being impacted by differences in how things are classified: if a
pregnancy ends without a live baby at week 22 or 23, is that a
miscarriage or the death of an infant? See for example the cited
<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25252091/">International comparisons of infant mortality and related factors: United States and Europe, 2010 </a></p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Even the year of death, 2017, isn't as straightforward as you might
think. For example, in the UK in 2016, the homicide rate rose
sharply. This was because an official inquest finally ruled that
ninety-six people who died in a crush at the Hillsborough football
stadium in 1989 had been unlawfully killed. Initially seen as an
accident, those deaths officially became homicides in 2016. This is
an extreme example, but there are often delays between when somebody
died and when the cause of death was officially registered." (page
77)</p>

<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Clarity should come first; advocacy can come once we understand the
facts." (page 78)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is not always clear whether someone intended to kill themselves;
sometimes people intended only to hurt themselves but died by
accident. In the UK, the Office for National Statistics draws a
clear line: if the child is fifteen or over, the death is assumed to
be deliberate; under the age of fifteen, it is assumed to be an
accident." (page 80)</p>

<h3>Chapter 4: <a href="#ch4" name="ch4">Put things in appropriate context.</a></h3>

<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Less illuminating [than a meaningful comparison] is the habit of
writing something along the lines of 'if the US national debt was a
pile of dollar bills it would stretch all the way to space/to the
moon/to the sun'. Some journalists seem to think this is a great way
to put a big number into context. Is it? Generally I find myself
stupider at reaching the end of such sentences. Do you know how many
dollar bills there are in a pile a yard high? (About eight thousand.
I had to look it up, of course. Anyone would.) Space is generally
regarded as being 100 kilometres above us, the moon is nearly
400,000 kilometres away, and the sun 150 million kilometres away&#8212;so
a pile that stretches to the sun is a lot bigger than one that
stretches to space. By my calculations, the US national debt would
be a pile of dollar bills reaching to the moon six times. Happy now?
I find it much clearer to note that it is about $70,000 per US
citizen." (page 100)</p>

their rarity; they are made forgettable by their ubiquity." (page

<p>"In the first chapter, I advised trying to notice your feelings
about the claim; in the second chapter, constructively
sense-checking the claim against your personal experience; in the
third chapter, asking yourself if you really understand what the
claim means. These are all simple, common-sense suggestions, and in
this chapter I've added a fourth: step back and look for information
that can put the claim into context." (page 108)</p>

<p>"If you have a result that looks publishable but fragile, the logic

academic grants and promotions tells you to publish at once, and for
goodness sake don't prod it too hard." (page 120)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"In general, more data is better. But if data are gathered bit by
bit, testing as we go, then the standard statistical tests aren't
valid. Those tests assume that the data have simply been gathered,
then tested&#8212;not that scientists have collected some data, tested
them, and then maybe collected a bit more." (page 121)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Daniel Kahneman himself dramatically raised the profile of the
issue [of reproducibility/reliability of research] when he wrote an
open <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/polopoly_fs/7.6716.1349271308!/suppinfoFile/Kahneman%20Letter.pdf">letter</a> to psychologists in the field warning them of a

<p>"The 'interestingness' filter is enormously powerful." (page 128)</p>

<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"There are encouraging signs that more researchers are welcoming
replication efforts. For example, in 2010, political scientists
Brendan Nyhan and Jason Reifler published a study on what became
known as 'the backfire effect'&#8212;in brief, that people were more
likely to believe a false claim if they'd been shown a fact-check
that debunked the claim. This caused a moral panic among some
journalists, particularly after the rise of Donald Trump.
Fact-checking only makes matters worse! It hit that perfect
counterintuitive sweet spot. But Nyhan and Reifler encouraged
further studies, and those studies suggest that the backfire effect
is unusual and fact-checking does help. One <a href="https://fullfact.org/blog/2019/mar/does-backfire-effect-exist/">summary</a> of the
research concluded: 'generally debunking can make people's beliefs
in specific claims more accurate'. Nyhan himself has quoted this
summary <a href="https://twitter.com/BrendanNyhan/status/1108377656414879744">on Twitter</a> when he sees people relying on his original
paper without considering the follow-ups." (page 135)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Many statisticians believe the crisis points to the need to rethink
the standard statistical tests themselves&#8212;that the very concept of
'statistical significance' is deeply flawed." (page 135)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"In general, if the chances of randomly observing data at least as
extreme as you collect are less than 5 per cent, the results are
'significant' enough to overturn the assumption: we can conclude
with a sufficient degree of confidence that the drug works, large
displays of jam discourage people from buying jam, and that
precognition exists.</p>
<p>"The problems are obvious. 5 per cent is an arbitrary cut-off
point&#8212;why not 6 per cent, or 4 per cent?&#8212;and it encourages us to
think in black-and-white, pass-or-fail terms, instead of embracing

<p>Page 136 also includes mention of a "journey towards more rigorous
science" which made me think. Statistical rigor is sort of the
problem, isn't it? At least, a certain interpretation of what rigor
is. The attraction of binary decision-making, significant or not
significant, has the feel of "rigor" - using a significance test feels
"rigorous." What we need is science that's more thoughtful, more
circumspect, less focused on reporting results via single-number
summaries. If that can be made to be what "rigor" means, then good.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Common preference models of family behavior imply income pooling, a
restriction on family demand functions such that only the sum of
husband's income and wife's income affects the allocation of goods
and time. Testing the pooling hypothesis is difficult because most
family income sources are not exogenous to the allocations being
analyzed. In this paper, we present an alternative test based on a
"natural experiment"-a policy change in the United Kingdom that
transferred a substantial child allowance to wives in the late
1970s. Using Family Expenditure Survey data, we find strong evidence
that a shift toward greater expenditures on women's clothing and
children's clothing relative to men's clothing coincided with this
income redistribution."</p>

<p>"Eventually, ProPublica <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing">published</a> their conclusions. Although
the COMPAS algorithm did not use an offender's race as a predictor,
it nevertheless was producing racially disparate results. It tended
to produce false positives for black offenders (predicting that they
would re-offend, but then they did not) and false negatives for
white offenders (predicting that they would not re-offend, but then
they did).</p>
<p>"That sounds very worrying: racial discrimination is both immoral
and illegal when coming from a human; we shouldn't tolerate it if it
emerges from an algorithm.</p>
<p>"But then four academic researchers, Sam Corbett-Davies, Emma
Pierson, Avi Feller and Sharad Goel, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08230">pointed out</a> that the
situation wasn't so clear-cut. They used the data laboriously
assembled by ProPublica to show that the algorithm was fair by
another important metric, which was that if the algorithm gave two
criminals&#8212;one black, one white&#8212;the same risk rating, then the actual
risk that they re-offended was the saem. In that respect the
algorithm was colour-blind.</p>
<p>"What's more, the researchers showed that it was impossible for the
algorithm to be fair in both ways simultaneously. It was possible to
craft an algorithm that would give an equal rate of false positives
for all races, and it was possible to craft an algorithm where the
risk ratings matched the re-offending risk for all races, but it
wasn't possible to do both at the same time: the numbers just
couldn't be made to add up." (pages 187-188)</p>

<p>"[Florence Nightingale] corresponded with the great Belgian
statistician Adolphe Quetelet. Quetelet was the person who
popularised the idea of taking the 'average' or 'arithmetic mean' of
a group, which was a revolutionary way to summarise complex data
with a single number." (page 233)</p>

<p>Two paragraphs just taken from Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"His most influential book was Sur l'homme et le d&#233;veloppement de
ses facult&#233;s, ou Essai de physique sociale, published in 1835 (In
English translation, it is titled Treatise on Man, but a literal
translation would be "On Man and the Development of his Faculties,
or Essays on Social Physics"). In it, he outlines the project of a
social physics and describes his concept of the "average man"
(l'homme moyen) who is characterized by the mean values of measured
variables that follow a normal distribution. He collected data about
many such variables."</p>
<p>"Adolphe Quetelet also had a significant influence on Florence
Nightingale who shared with him a religious view of statistics which
saw understanding statistics as revealing the work of God in
addition to statistics being a force of good administration.
Nightingale met Quetelet in person at the 1860 International
Statistical Congress in London, and they corresponded for years
afterwards."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it seems from this that he was mostly popularizing quantitative
methods in the social sciences. He had some idea of the "average man"
as a kind of Platonic Ideal (see <a href="https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/median-isnt-message/2013-01">Gould</a>), and (at least in the
interpretation of some) that variation around the mean is "error"...</p>

<p>"People often hold extreme political attitudes about complex
policies. We hypothesized that people typically know less about such
policies than they think they do (the illusion of explanatory depth)
and that polarized attitudes are enabled by simplistic causal
models. Asking people to explain policies in detail both undermined
the illusion of explanatory depth and led to attitudes that were
more moderate (Experiments 1 and 2). Although these effects occurred
when people were asked to generate a mechanistic explanation, they
did not occur when people were instead asked to enumerate reasons
for their policy preferences (Experiment 2). Finally, generating
mechanistic explanations reduced donations to relevant political
advocacy groups (Experiment 3). The evidence suggests that people&#8217;s
mistaken sense that they understand the causal processes underlying
policies contributes to political polarization."</p>

<p>"Although storytelling often has negative connotations within
science, narrative formats of communication should not be
disregarded when communicating science to nonexpert audiences.
Narratives offer increased comprehension, interest, and engagement.
Nonexperts get most of their science information from mass media
content, which is itself already biased toward narrative formats.
Narratives are also intrinsically persuasive, which offers science
communicators tactics for persuading otherwise resistant audiences,
although such use also raises ethical considerations. Future
intersections of narrative research with ongoing discussions in
science communication are introduced."</p>

alcohol, and skipping school. In subsequent research, they found
this correlation was entirely explained by the 19 percent of
self-reported adopted teenagers who weren't actually adopted.
Follow-up research has found that a meaningful percent of teenagers
tell surveys they are more than seven feet tall, weigh more than
four hundred pounds, or have three children. One survey found 99

segregated than you might think, in terms of people of all political
persuasions reading the most popular news sites and so on. He points
out also that "a surprising amount of the information people get on
Facebook comes from people with opposing views." This makes me wonder
how much the perception/reality of increased polarization is <em>caused
by</em> more communication and exposure to different views. If I never
hear about my aunt's crazy beliefs, I'm less likely to get upset about
them and feel like I need to advocate against them. Maybe hearing

going to Harvard vs. some other school may not be real.</p>

<p>This is about people writing on microfinance sites. Sounds about

<p>Strong praise for Jawbone on page 277, which turned out to be bad
timing as the company went under the year the book came out (2017)...</p>
<hr>
<p>On page 283 there's a reference to Ellenberg's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawking_Index">Hawking Index</a>,
which was amusing to me because I've enjoyed following Ellenberg a
little bit since reading his <a href="/20200925-how_not_to_be_wrong_by_ellenberg/">How Not to Be Wrong</a>.</p>

<title>Intuition, action, and luck (and Harry Potter)</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>When work is going well, it feels good. It feels playful. Not like
following a plan or map, but exploring freely with only the loosest
sense of a destination in mind, until you find you've solved your
problem. It feels <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn72qYmsWco">like</a> the <a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Felix_Felicis">luck potion</a> from the Harry Potter
world:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;What does it feel like?&#8221; whispered Hermione.</p>
<p>Harry did not answer for a moment. Then, slowly but surely, an
exhilarating sense of infinite opportunity stole through him; he
felt as though he could have done anything, anything at all . . .
and getting the memory from Slughorn seemed suddenly not only
possible, but positively easy. . . .</p>
<p>He got to his feet, smiling, brimming with confidence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Excellent,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Really excellent. Right . . . I&#8217;m going down
to Hagrid&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Why he knew that going to Hagrid&#8217;s was the right thing to do, he had
no idea. It was as though the potion was illuminating a few steps of
the path at a time: He could not see the final destination, he could
not see where Slughorn came in, but he knew that he was going the
right way to get that memory. When he reached the entrance hall he
saw that Filch had forgotten to lock the front door. Beaming, Harry
threw it open and breathed in the smell of clean air and grass for a
moment before walking down the steps into the dusk.</p>
<p>It was when he reached the bottom step that it occurred to him how
very pleasant it would be to pass the vegetable patch on his walk to
Hagrid&#8217;s. It was not strictly on the way, but it seemed clear to
Harry that this was a whim on which he should act, so he directed
his feet immediately toward the vegetable patch, where he was
pleased, but not altogether surprised, to find Professor Slughorn in
conversation with Professor Sprout. Harry lurked behind a low stone
wall, feeling at peace with the world and listening to their
conversation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's good to have this sense of "feeling at peace with the world" and
trying things even when you don't know for sure, consciously, how
they'll help. It's following your intuition in the sense of
<a href="/20210116-pragmatic_thinking_and_learning/">Pragmatic Thinking and Learning</a>.</p>
<p>It's also doing things because of "how very pleasant" they could be.
It's a bias toward action&#8211;playful action&#8211;and trying things that are
<a href="/20181204-worth_doing_even_if_it_fails/">worth doing even if they fail</a>.</p>
<p>There aren't any luck potions, but <a href="https://www.instituteforgiving.org/resources-for-fundraisers/fundraising-verities/item/313-verities-65-luck-favors-the-prepared-mind">luck favors the prepared mind</a>.
This kind of intuition-guided flow state isn't a consistent method,
but it's nice when it happens.</p>

<title>Vision and Mission</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<h3>Increasing the awareness of the universe</h3>
<p>I build and share understanding of the world to improve life for the
people I love most, and for everyone. I learn from others and from the
world, communicating and educating in turn to engage growth. I build
systems that contribute to these processes. I make improvements every
day to myself, my relationships, and the world around me.</p>
<hr>
<p>I was <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/1642500267/">inspired</a> to "refine" my personal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_statement">mission</a> statement, but
I had to make one first. I like brief <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_statement">vision</a> statements so I came
up with one of those as well.</p>
<p>I particularly like the vision, which can include lots of things I'm
interested in, including research, data science, and education.
There's a connection to <a href="https://westcoastword.wordpress.com/2013/04/22/chapter-7-the-purpose-of-life-from-breakfast-of-champions-by-kurt-vonnegut/">Vonnegut</a> as well:</p>
<pre>
What is the purpose of life?

To be
the eyes
and ears
and conscience
of the Creator of the Universe,
you fool.

<p>These sound different! The laptop mic has <em>tons</em> of room noise. I
think the Bose headphones are trying hard to do clever signal
processing which reduces background noise but also makes my voice more
muted and a little robotic in places. The Yeti is pretty good but
still picks up some unintended nearby sounds despite being in
directional mode.</p>

<title>The Big Con, by Maurer</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>Published in 1940, WWI was "the War" (page 28), WWII was "the present
European War" (page 311), there were thousand-dollar <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/6-famous-discontinued-and-uncommon-u-s-currency-denominations-4773302#1000-bill">G-notes</a>, and
there was quite a lot of sexism and racism (throughout). Instead of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam">emails from Nigerian princes</a>, you might see a classified ad in the
paper "For an honest, reliable businessman with $20,000 to invest for
a large return." (page 115) There were elaborate plots! Would you
really not fall for anything like that? What are people falling for
these days? Quite a lot! What a world, what a world.</p>
<p><img alt="cover" src="cover.jpg"></p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"After all, a look around present-day American institutions should
suffice to demonstrate that the character in question has now fully
emerged from the underworld and entered the mainstream, where he may
be far less colorful and imaginative, but no less on the grift."
(page xv, from the introduction by Luc Sante)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Their methods differ more in degree than in kind from those
employed by more legitimate forms of business." (page 3)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"The three big-con games, the <em>wire</em>, the <em>rag</em>, and the <em>pay-off</em>."
(page 3)</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><em>the wire</em>: "A big-con game in which the insideman (passing as a
   Western Union official) convinces the mark that he can delay the
   race results going to the book-makers long enough for the mark to
   place a bet after the race is run. The roper makes a mistake and
   the mark loses."</li>
<li><em>the rag</em>: "An intricate big-con game very similar to the pay-off,
   except that stocks are used instead of races. The insideman poses
   as an agent for a broker's syndicate which is trying to break the
   bucket-shops. The mark profits on several investments, is sent for
   a large sum of money, and is fleeced."</li>
<li><em>the pay-off</em>: "The most lucrative of all big-con games, with
   touches running from $10,000 up, with those of $100,000 being
   common. It operates on the principle that a wealthy mark is induced
   to believe that he has been taken into a deal whereby a large
   racing syndicate is to be swindled. At first he pays with money
   furnished him by the confidence men, then is put on the send for
   all the cash he can raise, fleeced, and blown off. The pay-off
   (invented in 1906) evolved from the short-pay at the track and was
   fully developed by 1910, when the big stores appeared in many of
   the larger cities."</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Most marks come from the upper strata of society, which, in
America, means that they have made, married, or inherited money.
Because of this, they acquire status which in time they come to
attribute to some inherent superiority, especially as regards
matters of sound judgment in finance and investment. Friends and
associates, themselves social climbers and sycophants, help to
maintain this illusion of superiority. Eventually, the mark comes to
regard himself as a person of vision and even of genius. Thus a
Babbitt who has cleared half a million in a real-estate development
easily forgets the part which luck and chicanery have played in his
financial rise; he accepts his mantle of respectability without
question; he na&#239;vely attributes his success to sound business
judgment. And any confidence man will testify that a real-estate man
is the fattest and juiciest of suckers." (page 104)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Religious scruples often seem to fail a mark at the crucial
moment." (page 105)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>""Larceny," or thieves' blood, runs not only in the veins of
professional thieves; it would appear that humanity at large has
just a dash of it&#8211;and sometimes more." (page 117)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Many con men feel that marks have one characteristic in common&#8211;they
are all liars." (page 118)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Such institutions [schools for grifters] have long been the delight
of fictioneers, but there is no reliable evidence to indicate that
they ever functioned in the American underworld." (page 160)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>The author references on page 164 "Dan the Dude's place at 28 W. 28th
St." as being a hangout for con men. It has been otherwise known as
well, <a href="https://ephemeralnewyork.wordpress.com/tag/28-west-28th-street/">it seems</a>.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"When we think of cheese, it's Wisconsin; when we speak of oil, it's
Pennsylvania; but with grifters, it's Indiana." (page 173)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"If fifty of them [con men] were selected and mixed indiscriminately
with a group of successful business and professional men, all the
correlations and statistics of a Hooton or a Lombroso would not set
them apart; and, if a census of opinions upon politics, ethics,
religion, or what-not were taken from the entire group, not even a
Solomon could separate the sheep from the goats on the basis of
their social views. If confidence men operate outside the law, it
must be remembered that they are not much further outside than many
of our pillars of society who go under names less sinister. They
only carry to an ultimate and very logical conclusion certain trends
which are often inherent in various forms of legitimate business."

card out of a deck he has offered to sell a mark very cheaply. They

<title>101 things to learn in art school, by Kit White</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>I picked up this little coffee table <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/101-things-learn-art-school">book</a> at the
<a href="https://bookshop.org/shop/themitpressbookstore">MIT Press Bookstore</a> a while ago. It's cute. Some good stuff in
there. I'm a sucker for this kind of format recently.</p>
<p><img alt="cover" src="cover.jpg"></p>
<hr>
<h3>My four favorite items from the book:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"16. Words are images. The power of the visual belongs to all things
received visually. The written word is both symbol and cognitive
catalyst; image and thought embodied. But words also conjure the
image that lives only as a thought or non-embodied object. Some
ideas are most potent when not embodied and exist as ephemeral,
fleeting experiences. Concept has form."</p>
<p>"25. Style is the consequence of something being described in the
way most appropriate to its content. It is not a hemline height or a
gratuitous decorative flourish added to modify or embellish an
image. Style is the by-product of saying what has to be said in the
most appropriate way a maker can say it. Meaningful style emerges
from the necessity of description; it is not a product of
self-conscious selection."</p>
<p>"29. "Conception cannot precede execution." (Maurice Merleau-Ponty,
<em>Sense and Non-Sense</em>) Art is a process of discovery through making,
and our ability to discover is generally greater than our ability to
invent. Think of your work process as a form of travel. Look for the
things you don't know, the things that are revealed or inadvertently
uncovered. It is easier to find a world than to make one."</p>
<p>"45. Work from your intuition, analyze with your intellect. To keep
your work spontaneous and inventive, try to draw upon what lies
beneath normal cognition in an uninhibited way. Intuition is not
hocus-pocus. It is simply a judgment system that operates without
immediately available conscious evidence. Intuition draws upon
subliminal knowledge and allows the unfiltered, unfamiliar, and
unknown to enter your work. Once there, you can apply your powers of
rational analysis to discover what you have done. At this stage, you
can always edit, but don't edit or preclude what does not yet
exist."</p>
</blockquote>

</ul>
<p>Sheldrake spins a charming tale, but may be taking some liberties. For
example, he claims on page 129 that "Miycorrhizal fungi soon found
their way into <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>." The quotes he follows this
with do not clearly support that claim, and there's no further
evidence to be found in the text or endnotes.</p>
<p>The author at one point addresses concerns about anthropomorphism,
especially relevant to considerations of "intelligent" behaviors, but
has few reservations about using metaphor freely. This isn't all bad.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is well-established in the sciences that metaphors can help to
generate new ways of thinking. The biochemist Joseph Needham
described a working analogy as a "net of coordinates" that could be
used to arrange an otherwise formless mass of information, much as a
sculptor might use a wire frame to provide support for wet clay. The
evolutionary biologist Richard Lewontin pointed out that it is
impossible to "do the work of science" without using metaphors,
given that almost "the entire body of science is an attempt to
explain phenomena that cannot be experienced directly by human
beings." Metaphors and analogies, in turn, come laced with human
stories and values, meaning that no discussion of scientific
ideas&#8211;this one included&#8211;can be free of cultural bias." (page 211)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Together with frequent stories, it makes for engaging reading. I
generally prefer the viewpoint he gives a paragraph to on page 174,
when he quotes Toby Spibille: "I try just to look at the system and
let the lichen be a lichen."</p>

<title>Pragmatic Thinking and Learning, by Andy Hunt</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>This 2008 <a href="https://pragprog.com/titles/ahptl/pragmatic-thinking-and-learning/">book</a> contained things both familiar and novel to me,
with a focus on creativity. One thing it describes is the
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Weinberg-Writing-Fieldstone-Gerald-M/dp/093263365X">fieldstone method</a>, which I think is close to my recent style of
collecting ideas. I'm trying the <a href="https://juliacameronlive.com/basic-tools/morning-pages/">morning pages</a> technique the book
also describes, and I think the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Gallwey#Inner_game">inner game</a> idea of teaching
awareness could be good. The book is an artifact of Hunt's experience,
drawing together and organizing ideas he'd encountered. Good stuff!</p>

<h3>Chapter 1: <a href="#intro" name="intro">Introduction</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>On page 2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Because of this complex interaction of many interested parties and
forces and the constant evolution of change, it seems to me that the
two most important modern skills are these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Communication skills</li>
<li>Learning and thinking skills"</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"The learning is always up to you." (page 3)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h3>Chapter 2: <a href="#journey" name="journey">Journey from novice to expert</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>Event theories vs. construct theories is kind of an interesting
division... See e.g. <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF03395570">Events and Constructs</a>. (Seems like
psychologists think about this distinction.)</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"... consider the case of the developer who claims ten years of
experience, but in reality it was one year of experience repeated
nine times. That doesn't count as <em>experience</em>." (page 15)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"The expert is very good at targeted, focused pattern matching."
(page 21)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's interesting how the focus on experts using intuition makes it
seem like experts are less "interpretable" than non-experts, in the
same way that neural networks are less interpretable than simpler
models.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"... the reality that there is anywhere from a 20:1 and 40:1
difference in productivity among developers, depending on whose
study you believe" (page 23, with footnote as follows) "In 1968, a
difference of 10:1 in productivity among programmers was noted in
<em>Exploratory experimental studies comparing online and offline
programming performance</em>. The gulf seems to have widened since
then."</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sadly, studies seem to indicate that most people, for most skills,
for most of their lives, never get any higher than the second stage
[of five], advanced beginner, "performing the tasks they need and
learning new tasks as the need arises but never acquiring a more
broad-based, conceptual understanding of the task environment.""

<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Beware decontextualized objectivity." (page 36)</p>

<h3>Chapter 3: <a href="#brain" name="brain">This is your brain</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>Interesting box on page 42 about PKMzeta in the brain being important
for memory (<a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/313/5790/1141.abstract" title="Storage of Spatial Information by the Maintenance Mechanism of LTP">ref</a>).</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Everyone&#8211;no matter their education, economic status, day job, or
age&#8211;has good ideas. But of this large number of people with good
ideas, far fewer bother to keep track of them. Of those, even fewer
bother to act on those ideas. Fewer still then have the resources to
make a good idea a success." (page 46)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>"Linear" L-mode and "Rich" R-mode as alternatives to "left brain" and
"right brain." He also calls it CPU #1 and CPU #2.</p>
<p>He references Guy Claxton's "Hare Brain, Tortoise Mind" which uses
"deliberate" d-mode and "undermind," Dan Pink's l-directed and
r-directed, and Betty Edwards' L mode and R mode. (page 50)</p>
<hr>
<h3>Chapter 4: <a href="#right" name="right">Get in your right mind</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>Emphasis on multi-sensory (even seemingly pointless multi-sensory,

<p>"Metaphor, a common ground for both verbalizations and images, is a
way to voyage back and forth between the subconscious and conscious,
between right and left hemispheres." (from Conscious/Unconscious
Interaction in a creative act, Gordon and Poze)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>Metaphor</em> comes from the Greek meaning "to transfer," with the
idea that you are transferring the properties of one object to
another in a way that is not literally possible." (page 75)</p>

<hr>
<p>Ways to try to get ideas (etc.) from your subconscious:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Image streaming" (close your eyes and describe out loud what you
   see)</li>
<li>Free-form journaling (blogging, letter-writing, etc.)</li>
<li>"Morning pages" (write three pages first thing in the morning)</li>
<li>Just write (mentions Weinberg's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Weinberg-Writing-Fieldstone-Gerald-M/dp/093263365X">fieldstone method</a>, which is
   close to what I try to do, I think)</li>

<blockquote>
<p>"When faced with a thorny problem, Dave Thomas will often say, "Turn
that on its head." That's one <em>mental wack</em>: a way to knock you out
of your rut to make you look at a problem from a different point of

<p>"For instance, audio engineers use a well-known technique when
mixing a recording. To make the sound as good as possible, they
first go through and make each instrument sound <em>as bad</em> as
possible."</p>

<p>Ideas about four repeating generation "archetypes" (hero, artist,
prophet, nomad) from Howe and Strauss, in e.g. the 2007
<a href="https://hbr.org/2007/07/the-next-20-years-how-customer-and-workforce-attitudes-will-evolve">The Next 20 Years: How Customer and Workforce Attitudes Will Evolve</a>,
which says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Three of those generations will still be vital forces in American
society 20 years from now: Boomers, Generation X, and Millennials.
Their attitudes and behaviors will have profound effects on the
economy, the workplace, and social institutions in general. For
example, as aging Boomers eschew high-tech medicine in favor of
holistic self-care, natural foods, and mind-body healing techniques,
some hospitals are opening new wings featuring alternative medicine
and spiritual counseling. Gen Xers, having grown up in an era of
failing schools and marriages, will remain alienated, disaffected,
and pragmatic as they enter midlife. Already the greatest
entrepreneurial generation in U.S. history, they will be highly
effective at pushing innovation, efficiency, and mass customization.
In contrast, young adult Millennials will favor teamwork, close
family relationships, job security, and a bland popular culture.
Their unprecedented digital empowerment and talent for organizing
will create a political powerhouse and may even revitalize the union
movement."</p>

<p>"Create a Pragmatic Investment Plan" (page 133)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(This refers to investing in <em>learning</em>.)</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Unfortunately, relegating learning activities to your "free time"
is a recipe for failure." (page 133)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>On page 139 Hunt talks about Sternberg's
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triarchic_theory_of_intelligence">Triarchic theory of intelligence</a>, but his description is different
from what Wikipedia says... Wikipedia says it's these three:</p>
<ul>
<li>Componential &#8211; analytical</li>
<li>Experiential &#8211; creative</li>
<li>Practical - contextual</li>
</ul>
<p>But Hunt says "Sternberg sees a three-part mind, composed of a
meta-level component that manages thought processes overall;
performance-based components that do tasks, make associations, and so
on; and, finally, knowledge-acquisition components that handle
assimilating new information."</p>
<p>Maybe these line up somehow, but I don't see it from here.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Reading groups are nontoxic." (page 141)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Strong praise!</p>
<hr>
<p>Describes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQ3R">SQ3R</a> (Survey, Question, Read, Recite, Review).</p>
<hr>
<p>On page 146, the "Test-Driven Learning" box (a play on Test-Driven
Development) talks about spaced repetition. It mentions <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperMemo">SuperMemo</a>
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemosyne_(software)">Mnemosyne</a>, and references
<a href="https://web.mit.edu/jbelcher/www/learner/retrieval.pdf">The Critical Importance of Retrieval for Learning</a>, which is a
pretty great ref.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"As you go to add a new piece of information, a new thought, or an
insight to the mind map, you are faced with the question, where does
this belong? You have to evaluate the <em>relationships</em> between ideas,
not just the ideas themselves, and that can be a very revealing
activity." (page 149)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"The most value, I find, is to take the raw notes while listening
(which helps you stay focused as you extract salient points from the
lecture) and then transcribe these raw notes into "official notes."
Even if I never read these notes again, the act of transcribing the
raw notes is the most valuable portion of this exercise. You can do
the same thing with mind maps-start with a rough messy one, and
redraw it as needed. The redrawing helps form more associations in
your brain." (page 150)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is very much like <a href="/20201124-take_notes_like_paul_halmos/">the method of Paul Halmos</a>.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Use a mind map to help clarify." (page 152)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Page 154 has an interesting reference to <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Damon_Navandi/publication/268871823_Prepared_Mind_insight/links/547a09dd0cf205d1687fab98/Prepared-Mind-insight.pdf">The Prepared Mind</a>: Neural
Activity Prior to Problem Presentation Predicts Subsequent Solution by
Sudden Insight:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A recent study suggests that mental preparation <em>that involves an
inward focus of attention</em> can promote flashes of insight, even if
the preparation occurs well in advance of facing any particular
problem."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This reference isn't really applicable to the book's topic there
(documentation). It isn't super clear how to get the mental focus the
researchers identify, or whether we really care because it seems like
it didn't help people solve more problems, but only to be more likely
to report that they solved via a flash of insight. And the problems in
question are like "pine, crab, sauce" ("apple") so it isn't clear how
useful this is anyway.</p>
<p>I think Hunt is right that "it might be that <em>documenting</em> is more
important than <em>documentation</em>" but his reference doesn't support that
claim.</p>

<h3>Chapter 7: <a href="#gain" name="gain">Gain experience</a></h3>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"we build to learn, not learn to build." (page 160)</p>

<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"You need to unlearn just as much as you need to learn." (page 164)</p>

<hr>
<p>Hunt riffs on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Gallwey#Inner_game">inner game</a> to talk about increasing your
awareness to increase your feedback and improve your improvement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"the idea is to teach the student awareness and to use that
awareness to correct their performance." (page 170)</p>
<p>"This is a key aspect to playing the inner game: don't focus on
correcting individual details, but just be aware. Accept <em>what is</em>
as a first step, and just be aware of it. Don't judge, don't rush in
with a solution, don't criticize." (page 170)</p>
<p>"Don't just do something; stand there." (page 171)</p>
<p>"The Inner Game series sums up this idea with the phrase, "Trying
fails, awareness cures.""</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h3>Chapter 8: <a href="#focus" name="focus">Manage focus</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>Hunt recommends <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vipassan%C4%81">meditation</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>In "Defocus to Focus" (page 187) on thinking about problems
creatively:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"it's not the idea of not doing <em>anything</em>, it's the idea of not
doing <em>something</em>."</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Hunt advances Dennett's ideas from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness_Explained">Consciousness Explained</a>, saying
"Multiple drafts form consciousness."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"That makes consciousness a bottom-up, self-organizing, perhaps even
emergent property." (page 189)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Have you heard of the consultant's Rule of Three? In general, if
you can't think of three ways a plan can go wrong or think of three
different solutions to a problem, then you haven't thought it
through enough." (page 189)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A footnote attributes this to Jerry Weinberg's <em>The Secrets of
Consulting</em>.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Thomas Jeffereson owned somewhere in the neighborhood of 10,000
books in his lifetime. And donated nearly 7,000 of them to form the
core of the Library of Congress in 1815. (page 191)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Hunt advocates using a personal wiki.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The real beauty of this approach is that once you have a place to
put a specific bit of information, you'll notice that new, relevant
bits of data suddenly start to show up out of nowhere. It's a
similar phenomenon to <em>sense tuning</em>."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He doesn't quite manage to say Baader-Meinhof.</p>
<p>The idea also aligns with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Weinberg-Writing-Fieldstone-Gerald-M/dp/093263365X">fieldstone method</a>, I think.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Multitasking takes a heavy toll on productivity. One study found
that in general, multitasking can cost you 20 to 40 percent of your
productivity."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The "study" is footnoted as
http://www.umich.edu/~bcalab/multitasking.html, which is a collection
of links to papers... Not sure what it's referencing in particular.</p>
<hr>
<p>He recommends using one of those focus apps that blocks out the
internet etc. He references "Think!" and DeskTopple. Current options
seem to be <a href="https://zapier.com/blog/stay-focused-avoid-distractions/">different</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Chapter 9: <a href="#beyond" name="beyond">Beyond expertise</a></h3>
<p>This is a brief conclusion, and I mostly liked that the <a href="https://twitter.com/PragmaticAndy">author</a>
wrapped up by giving his email address and inviting feedback.</p>

<title>The Enchiridion in 52 sentences</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enchiridion_of_Epictetus">Enchiridion</a> isn't long, but it also doesn't have chapter

<title>Predicting the future from 2021</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>Second year of doing <a href="/20200112-predicting_the_future_from_2020/">these</a>! Let's make some predictions for 1, 5,
10, and 20 years out!</p>
<h3>By 2022</h3>
<ul>
<li>Vaccine effective in controlling all strains of COVID-19.</li>
<li>No additional pandemic on the scale of COVID-19.</li>
<li>Donald Trump indicted.</li>
<li>S&amp;P 500 closes above 4,000.</li>
</ul>
<h3>By 2026</h3>
<ul>
<li>At least one of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook,_Apple,_Amazon,_Netflix_and_Google">FAANG</a> split up by government intervention.</li>
<li>Joe Biden is dead.</li>
<li>Democratic presidential ticket of Harris and Buttigieg loses.
   [<a href="#1">1</a>]</li>
<li>Intelligent extraterrestrials clearly real and communicating with
   humans. [<a href="#2">2</a>]</li>
<li>S&amp;P 500 closes above 6,000.
 <!-- * My grandparents are dead. --></li>
</ul>
<h3>By 2031</h3>
<ul>
<li>S&amp;P 500 closes above 8,000.</li>
</ul>
<h3>By 2041</h3>
<ul>
<li>S&amp;P 500 closes above 12,000.</li>
</ul>
<p>[<a name="1" href="#1">1</a>] What odds would you give me?</p>
<p>[<a name="2" href="#2">2</a>] I've included one low-probability, never
occurred before, possibly impossible prediction, at the recommendation
of my sister. There were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haim_Eshed">Haim Eshed</a>'s claims, after all, and those
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagon_UFO_videos">videos</a>. And wouldn't it be fun? I'll give aliens an optimistic 2%
for the next five years and reevaluate then as needed.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Reviewing predictions from 2020</h3>
<p>All my one-year <a href="/20200112-predicting_the_future_from_2020/">predictions</a> were correct, at least if you interpret my
"S&amp;P under 3,000" as meaning any time during the year, not just at the
end of the year.</p>
<p>I'm feeling more optimistic about the stock market now than I was last
year. Maybe that's a sign that it'll do more poorly now?</p>
<p>I had Justice Ginsberg dead by 2025, so my timing was sadly not
maximally precise.</p>
<p>Most of my predictions from last year were very conservative.
Understanding the present is a good method for predicting the near
future, but it isn't very interesting.</p>
<p>I have less to say about the farther future. It's harder to predict,
and I already <a href="/20200112-predicting_the_future_from_2020/">predicted</a> some things in the range of 10-20 years
out last year. No changing them now! I'm also just thinking more about
personal plans/goals; this stuff is just for fun.</p>
<h3>Probabilistic predictions?</h3>
<p><a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/04/29/predictions-for-2020/">Some people</a> assign probabilities to all their predictions, and I
think this isn't very interesting, because it's easy to nod along with
probabilities. Predictions are interesting when they're surprising,
and certainty can increase surprise.</p>
<p>It would be possible to compare probabilities between people and see
where they're most different. I could imagine making a little web
survey/app for this, which might be fun and good to do in a class
learning about <a href="/20201221-ulysses_compass/">cross-entropy</a>, for example.</p>
<p>A possible taxonomy of predictions by probability:</p>
<ul>
<li>Very likely based on the present. (More hurricanes.)</li>
<li>Coin flip. (Old person dies in some period.)</li>
<li>Slightly unlikely. (Underdog wins something.)</li>
<li>Very rare but known possible. (Pandemic.)</li>
<li>Possibly impossible. (Aliens visit Earth for wine and cheese party.)</li>
</ul>
<p>It's the very likely ones that make the most sense to think about most
of the time, I think, both because they don't require hedging and
because there's less uncertainty <em>in the estimate of the probability
itself</em>.</p>
<h3>COVID-19 and the right questions</h3>
<p>COVID-19 is the big thing that wasn't predicted for 2020: very rare
but known possible. I'm not going to predict any other things in this
category this year either, because that's easier and usually right.</p>
<p>When I wrote my 2020 predictions, there was already some news about
COVID-19. Is there something like that right now that I'm missing? I
googled "early signs" but didn't find anything likely to make me seem
perspicacious.</p>
<p>The things that turn out to be important are hard to predict because
you have to ask the right questions to even consider them. What aren't
we considering now that will turn out to be important?</p>

<title>The weather outside is frightening</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>Based on ten years of daily GHCN data, it is too cold, too hot, and
too wet out there. Best chances for livable weather: parts of the
Mexican plateau, California, and maybe Hawaii.</p>
<p><img src="chance_of_freezing.png" width="49%">
<img src="chance_of_heat.png" width="49%">
<img src="chance_of_precipitation.png" width="49%">
<img src="most_habitable.png" width="49%"></p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="temp" href="#temp">Temperature</a></h3>
<p>Lots of land is up north where it gets cold, and everything around the
equator gets too hot. Is there a Goldilocks region in between that's
"just right" year-round? No. Your best hope is Stockholm syndrome: "I
love the seasons!"</p>
<p><img src="chance_of_freezing.png" width="49%">
<img src="chance_of_heat.png" width="49%"></p>
<p>To get a moderate temperature all year, you have to rely on oceans, or
mountainous elevations, or both. Thanks a lot, solar system.</p>
<h3><a name="prcp" href="#prcp">Precipitation</a></h3>
<p>Even with over 15 thousand stations and ten years of <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/land-based-station-data/land-based-datasets/global-historical-climatology-network-ghcn">GHCN</a> data,
there's spotty coverage for Africa, South America, and Asia. It also
looks like the US precipitation data may be systematically different
from Canadian and Mexican data. Thanks a lot, humans.</p>
<p><img alt="Chance of precipitation" src="chance_of_precipitation.png"></p>
<p>Precipitation: Can't live with it, can't have nice plants without it.
Thanks a lot, water cycle. Let's say once every six to nine days is
acceptable to avoid deserts.</p>
<h3><a name="habitable" href="#habitable">Habitable areas</a></h3>
<p><img alt="Even slightly habitable" src="even_slightly_habitable.png"></p>
<p>Mexico! With ocean on two sides and a high plateau to cut the
temperature and humidity, Mexico ought to be where everybody lives.
<a href="https://weather-and-climate.com/average-monthly-Rainfall-Temperature-Sunshine,zacatecas-zacatecas-mx,Mexico">Zacatecas</a> seems particularly good.</p>
<p>California has some okay spots, like San Diego and Monterey. Look out
for forest fires.</p>
<p>Hawaii isn't out of bounds, but even the lows are high, so if you
aren't at the beach it might not be ideal. Avoid the volcanoes.</p>
<p>Then there are survivable places, including lots of the west coast of
the Americas, New Zealand, and the southern coast of Australia. The
tip of South Africa and large parts of Europe could be okay. I think
that's roughly Japan and Korea seeming not quite deadly.</p>
<h3><a name="methods" href="#methods">Methods</a></h3>
<p>This slapdash analysis <a href="https://github.com/ajschumacher/ajschumacher.github.io/blob/master/20201230-weather_outside_is_frightening/prepare_data.sh">gathers some data</a> and visualizes it with a
Python <a href="https://github.com/ajschumacher/ajschumacher.github.io/blob/master/20201230-weather_outside_is_frightening/visualize.ipynb">notebook</a>, which has all the details and a few more fun
maps.</p>
<p>The chances of cold, heat, and precipitation are fractions of days
with low temperature under 0&#176; C (32&#176; F), high temperature over 30&#176; C
(86&#176; F), and precipitation over one millimeter, respectively. The
precipitation score may have issues. The scales on these maps go all
the way from 0% to 100%, using the plasma color scale. Legends are
ugly.</p>
<p>A location's score is the sum of the cold score, hot score, and
distance of the precipitation score from the range 1/6 to 1/9. It's
not quite a rate any more, just a badness score. The "Most habitable"
map colors scores less than 1/4, and the "Even slightly habitable" map
colors scores less than 3/5. <em>Do you really want to live somewhere
with a score over 60%?</em></p>

<title>Estimate manifold dimensionality with LID</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>Local Intrinsic Dimensionality (LID) is based on assuming locally
uniform density and using the geometric idea that in \( D \)
dimensions the volume of a ball with radius \( r \) goes as \( r^D
\). With an outer radius \( r_{\text{bound}} \) from some point and
a distance \( r \lt r_{\text{bound}} \) to a neighboring point, the
maximum likelihood estimator of LID is \( 1 / \log{\left(
r_{\text{bound}}/r \right)} \), and multiple estimates are averaged
with the harmonic mean.</p>

<p>For example, Swiss roll data curves through three dimensions but only
on a two-dimensional manifold. LID for the three-dimensional Swiss
roll data is about two, which is informative.</p>

technical commentary.</p>
<h3><a name="derivation" href="#derivation">Mathematical derivation of LID</a></h3>
<p>Local Intrinsic Dimensionality arises from considering radius from a
given point to another point nearer than \( r_{\text{bound}} \) as a
random variable \( R \) which takes a specific value \( r \).</p>
<h4><a name="cdf" href="#cdf">Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of radius</a></h4>
<p>With uniform density, the probability of encountering a point is
proportional to volume, and the volume of a radius \( r \) ball in
\( D \) dimensions is proportional to \( r^D \), giving the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function">CDF</a>.</p>
<p>\[ P(R&lt;r) = \frac{r^D}{r_{\text{bound}}^D} = \left(\frac{r}{r_{\text{bound}}}\right)^D \]</p>
<h4><a name="pdf" href="#pdf">Probability Density Function (PDF) of radius</a></h4>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_function">PDF</a> is the derivative of the CDF with respect to \( r \).</p>
<p>\[ P(R=r) = D \left( \frac{r}{r_{\text{bound}}} \right)^{D-1} \]</p>
<h4><a name="ev" href="#ev">Expected Value of radius</a></h4>
<p>Integrating the PDF times \( r \) from 0 to \( r_{\text{bound}} \)
gives the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value">expected value</a> of \( R \), which is \( \frac{D}{D+1}
r_{\text{bound}} \). This isn't terribly important to the derivation
here, but it shows that as dimensionality increases, points are likely
to be closer and closer to the outer radius. This is an aspect of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality">curse of dimensionality</a> and the phenomenon that LID is based on.</p>
<h4><a name="mle" href="#mle">Maximum Likelihood Estimate of dimension</a></h4>
<p>For a given measured \( r \) within \( r_{\text{bound}} \), some
dimensionality \( D \) maximizes the likelihood of that observation.
The probability density function is a likelihood, and the log of that
function has the same maximum where both derivatives are zero. Setting
the derivative with respect to \( D \) of the natural log likelihood
equal to zero gives a simple solution.</p>
<p>\[ \log{\left( \frac{r}{r_{\text{bound}}} \right)} + \frac{1}{D} = 0 \]</p>
<p>\[ D = \frac{1}{\log{ \left( \frac{r_{\text{bound}}}{r} \right)}} \]</p>
<p>This choice of natural log is not arbitrary, because a derivative is
taken; using a different log base would introduce an additional
constant factor.</p>
<h4><a name="harmonic" href="#harmonic">Harmonic mean for dimensionality</a></h4>
<p>With two observed radii \( r_1 \) and \( r_2 \), the joint
probability is two (PDF) likelihoods multiplied together, and the log
likelihood sums. Maximizing gives the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_mean">harmonic mean</a> of two
individual estimates.</p>
<p>\[ \log{\left( \frac{r_1}{r_{\text{bound}}} \right)} + \frac{1}{D} + \log{\left( \frac{r_2}{r_{\text{bound}}} \right)} + \frac{1}{D} = 0 \]</p>
<p>\[ D = \frac{2}{\log{\left( \frac{r_{\text{bound}}}{r_1} \right)} + \log{\left( \frac{r_{\text{bound}}}{r_2} \right)}} \]</p>
<p>The same thing happens for any number of measurements; the harmonic
mean is the appropriate way to average estimates of dimensionality.</p>
<p>The harmonic mean is typically appropriate for averaging <em>rates</em>, so
its appearance here suggests thinking of <em>dimension</em> as a <em>rate</em>.
Perhaps dimension is the rate at which "space" becomes available, or
entropy becomes possible, per distance traveled.</p>
<h3><a name="caveats" href="#caveats">Caveats</a></h3>
<p>It's very common for distance to not really make sense in a dataset.
Scaling of variables can be very important, for example (not to
mention categorical variables).</p>
<p>Even with a meaningful distance, in high dimensions, "nearest
neighbors" <a href="https://members.loria.fr/MOBerger/Enseignement/Master2/Exposes/beyer.pdf" title="When Is &#8220;Nearest Neighbor&#8221; Meaningful?">may not be meaningful</a>.</p>
<p>Euclidean distance is assumed here, but <a href="https://bib.dbvis.de/uploadedFiles/155.pdf" title="On the Surprising Behavior of Distance Metrics in High Dimensional Space">other distances</a> may also
be worth considering. There is also an <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12880" title="ABID: Angle Based Intrinsic Dimensionality">angle-based approach</a> to
estimating LID.</p>
<h3><a name="literature" href="#literature">LID in the literature</a></h3>
<p>A common reference is <a href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~bickel/mldim.pdf" title="Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Intrinsic Dimension">Levina and Bickel</a>, "Maximum Likelihood
Estimation of Intrinsic Dimension." Their derivation is slightly
different, but the result is the same: their Equation 8 is
<a href="#mle">the MLE above</a> in different notation.</p>
<p>Levina and Bickel suggest an adjustment to the harmonic mean when \(
k \rightarrow \infty \). In practice it may be better to keep \( k
\) small in the interest of maintaining locality and not adjust.</p>
<p>Another form of the MLE sometimes appears (e.g. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.02613" title="Characterizing Adversarial Subspaces Using Local Intrinsic Dimensionality">1</a>, <a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/1.9781611975673.21" title="Intrinsic Dimensionality Estimation within Tight Localities">2</a>) but is
not recommended.</p>
<p>\[ \widehat{LID}(x) = -\left( \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=1}^k{ \log{ \frac{r_i(x)}{r_k(x)} } } \right)^{-1} \]</p>
<p>In this form, \( r_i(x) \) is the distance to the \( i\text{-th}
\) nearest neighbor of the point \( x \), and \( r_k(x) \) is the
maximum of these distances. Here the \( k \) neighbors include the
farthest one, defining \( r_k(x) \), which is elsewhere called \(
r_{\text{bound}} \). The effect of this inclusion is to add a \(
\log(1) = 0 \) term to the sum (which would not be meaningful as an
individual estimate) or equivalently to average \( k-1 \) estimates
as if there were \( k \). With two nearest neighbors, this will
incorrectly double the estimate, and it will always inflate it to some
degree.</p>
<p>In addition to the arithmetic mean, sometimes a regression approach is
used to combine estimates of dimensionality. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-11873-y.pdf" title="Estimating the intrinsic dimension of datasets by a minimal neighborhood information">Facco et al.</a> apply
such an approach, noting and dropping large outliers in order to get
more robust estimates. The <a href="#harmonic">harmonic mean</a> (itself
<a href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/264368/harmonic-mean-minimizes-sum-of-squared-relative-errors" title="Harmonic mean minimizes sum of squared relative errors">a kind of robust regression</a>) is more appropriate.</p>
<h3><a name="topological" href="#topological">Topological extensions</a></h3>
<p>Topological approaches use nearest neighbors to turn point-like data
into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)">graph</a>-like data (okay, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplicial_complex">simplicial complexes</a>). <a href="https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">UMAP</a> is
a popular modern technique based on this idea.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://web.mit.edu/cocosci/Papers/sci_reprint.pdf" title="A Global Geometric Framework for Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction">Isomap</a>, a graph enforces geodesic distances, staying on the
manifold via neighbors connected in the graph. For estimating
dimensionality, a graph lets you avoid polluting the set of nearest
neighbors with points from actually distant parts of the manifold
(imagine jumping between sheets in Swiss roll data, for example). Some
work on dimensionality (e.g. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep31377" title="Accurate Estimation of the Intrinsic Dimension Using Graph Distances: Unraveling the Geometric Complexity of Datasets">A</a>, <a href="http://hal.cse.msu.edu/assets/pdfs/papers/2019-cvpr-intrinsic-dimensionality.pdf" title="On the Intrinsic Dimensionality of Image Representations">B</a>) involves this approach.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Wolfram">Stephen Wolfram</a> has some <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/">topological ideas about physics</a>,
including a very literal <a href="https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/limiting-behavior-and-emergent-geometry/the-notion-of-dimension/">interpretation of dimensionality</a> being
the rate at which traveling a distance gives you access to more space.</p>

<title>Ulysses' compass</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>These are some <a href="big.html">slides</a> for a book club discussion of
Chapter 7 from McElreath's <a href="https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/">Statistical Rethinking</a>. See also
McElreath's own <a href="https://github.com/rmcelreath/statrethinking_winter2019">slides and video presentations</a>.</p>
<hr>
<pre><code>&#128009; Scylla of overfitting
  &#9973; Ulysses' compass &#129517;
&#127786; Charybdis of underfitting</code></pre>

<hr>
<p>The title of the chapter is "Ulysses' Compass." McElreath loves to
give his chapters cute names that don't necessarily mean anything to
you until you've read the chapter.</p>
<p>What do we value: simplicity or accuracy? The chapter is about
navigating between overfitting and underfitting, which McElreath notes
briefly (page 201) is related to but distinct from the bias variance
trade-off. I think the difference he's alluding to is about what a
model is <em>capable</em> of representing (bias/variance) vs. what it <em>does</em>
represent (under/overfitting).</p>
<hr>
<p><img alt="overfitting" src="overfitting.jpg"></p>
<hr>
<p>In section 7.1, "The problem with parameters" is that too many can
make it easy to overfit. It's a fairly standard presentation of
overfitting via polynomial regression and hating on R<sup>2</sup> (or
any naive score on the training data).</p>
<hr>
<pre><code class="language-python">from math import log

# Truth (as in Problem 7E1)
p = [0.7, 0.3]  # heads, tails</code></pre>

<hr>
<p>So now it's time to do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory">information theory</a>. Here we go!</p>
<p>This section was the most interesting to me, so I'm going to spend
some time on it here. I felt like his explanations were helpful, and
I've encountered the material in less cogent ways previously, so I
appreciated the chance to think things through all together a bit.</p>
<p>I'll do a running example where the true probabilities of heads and
tails for a coin (say) are 0.7 and 0.3. (We never really know the true
probabilities.)</p>
<hr>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Entropy, H(p)
H = lambda p: -sum(p_i * log(p_i) for p_i in p)
H(p)  # 0.6108643020548935</code></pre>

<hr>
<p>So we get entropy, which measures how uncertain things are. (He gives
some motivating criteria and implies it could be derived.)</p>
<hr>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Candidate "models"
q = [0.5, 0.5]
r = [0.9, 0.1]</code></pre>

<hr>
<p>So say we have these two "models" for that coin.</p>
<p>(These are just point estimates, not whole posterior distributions.)</p>
<hr>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Cross-Entropy, H(p, q), xH here because Python
xH = lambda p, q: -sum(p_i * log(q_i) for p_i, q_i in zip(p, q))
xH(p, q)  # 0.6931471805599453
xH(p, r)  # 0.764527888858692</code></pre>

<hr>
<p>Cross-entropy tells us something about how well a model goes with the
truth. (Well; how un-well: lower scores are better.)</p>
<p>The best score is what you get using the true model, which is the
entropy of the true model.</p>
<p>In lots of my models, we use cross-entropy loss, and we generally just
implicitly round all the "true" probabilities to one or zero, or do
something nearly as unjustified.</p>
<hr>
<pre><code class="language-python"># KL Divergence, D(p, q)
D = lambda p, q: sum(p_i * log(p_i/q_i) for p_i, q_i in zip(p, q))
D(p, q)  # 0.08228287850505178
D(p, r)  # 0.15366358680379852</code></pre>

<hr>
<p>Divergence then is just cross-entropy with the entropy subtracted off,
so that the best you can do is zero.</p>
<hr>
<pre><code class="language-python"># D(p, q) = H(p, q) - H(p)
D(p, q) == xH(p, q) - H(p)  # True</code></pre>

<hr>
<p>The other one doesn't happen to come out exactly due to floating point
math; what luck that the first one does!</p>
<p>So we wish we could use divergence to evaluate models, but we can't
because we never really know the true underlying model <code>p</code>. All we get
are data.</p>
<p>(If instead we're assuming that all the data is really 100% likely,
then H(p) is 0 and there's nothing to subtract off.)</p>
<p>The key insight in general is that even if we don't know <code>p</code>, when we
compare two models' scores by subtracting them, the <code>p</code> goes away, so
we can still get relative scores even without <code>p</code>.</p>
<hr>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Data
d = [0, 0, 1]  # heads, heads, tails</code></pre>

<hr>
<p>So here are some data.</p>
<hr>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Log probability (likelihood) score
S = lambda d, p: sum(log(p[d_i]) for d_i in d)
S(d, q)  # -2.0794415416798357
S(d, r)  # -2.513306124309698</code></pre>

<hr>
<p>So we switch now to just using the sum of log likelihoods of the data
given the model as the model's score.</p>
<p>This score is the same as the "cross-entropy" I often use, which is
the same also as divergence, when we're saying all the true
probabilities are zero or one.</p>
<p>Higher scores are better here.</p>
<hr>
<p>Positive log likelihoods happen!</p>
<hr>
<p>Positive log likelihoods caused me a little bit of consternation,
because I'd been thinking in terms of probabilities rather than
probability distributions. But really when you have a distribution,
you're using a density, which can be greater than one. So the log
could be positive.</p>
<hr>
<pre><code class="language-python"># True vs. predictive
S(d, p)  # -1.917322692203401
S(d, [2/3, 1/3])
         # -1.9095425048844388</code></pre>

<hr>
<p>The true model isn't necessarily the one that scores best on a given
sample of data.</p>
<hr>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Deviance
deviance = lambda d, p: -2 * S(d, p)
S(d, p)         # -1.917322692203401
deviance(d, p)  #  3.834645384406802</code></pre>

<hr>
<p>Then it's also common to switch to deviance, to make something nice
happen with chi-squared distributions or something. Now smaller scores
are better.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Regular</em>ization!</p>
<hr>
<p>From the information theory stuff, he really wants to develop
information criteria, but first he talks about regularization.</p>
<p>He points out that it's sort of about pulling out the "regular"
patterns in the data, rather than overfitting to chance patterns. Nice
little mnemonic.</p>
<p>Bayesians are pretty smug about regularization, because they get it
essentially for free by adjusting their priors.</p>
<p>The chapter also has some material on robust regression, which
Bayesian's are also pretty smug about because it's relatively easy for
them to just swap out the normal distribution for something with
fatter tails.</p>
<hr>
<p><img alt="silly meme" src="silly_meme.png"></p>
<hr>
<p>Next it's on to "Predicting predictive accuracy." McElreath talks a
little bit about cross-validation, but it's pretty clear his true love
is information criteria.</p>
<p>I generally prefer (read: "actually use") cross-validation.</p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>AIC: Akaike Information Criterion</li>
<li>BIC: Bayesian Information Criterion (aka Schwarz criterion)</li>
<li>CV: Cross-Validation</li>
<li>DIC: Deviance Information Criterion</li>
<li>lppd: Log Pointwise Predictive Density</li>
<li>PSIS: Pareto-smoothed importance sampling cross-validation</li>
<li>R^2: "variance explained" or "coefficient of determination"</li>
<li>WAIC: [Widely Applicable | Watanabe-Akaike] Information Criterion</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>So he talks about his favorites, PSIS and WAIC. They seem fine.</p>
<hr>
<p>compare but don't select</p>
<hr>
<p>Then he says not to do model selection, in the sense of throwing out
models and what you learned from them in the process.</p>
<hr>
<pre><code># Mine (Python)
def sum_log_prob(a, b):
    return max(a, b) + math.log1p(math.exp(0 - abs(a - b)))

# McElreath's (R)
log_sum_exp &lt;- function( x ) {
    xmax &lt;- max(x)
    xsum &lt;- sum( exp( x - xmax ) )
    xmax + log(xsum)
}</code></pre>

<hr>
<p>Little sidebar (as also McElreath had one): Multiplying probabilities
that you have the logs of is easy, because you just add the logs.
Adding log probabilities is more annoying. But you can be a little
clever about it and it works out! I needed this recently while playing
with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Petersburg_paradox">St. Petersburg paradox</a>.</p>
<p>Mine is based on a <a href="https://gasstationwithoutpumps.wordpress.com/2014/05/06/sum-of-probabilities-in-log-prob-space/">post from Kevin Karplus</a>. I found McElreath's on
a <a href="https://rdrr.io/github/rmcelreath/rethinking/src/R/distributions.r">post on rdrr</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Ulysses' compass</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't overfit</li>
<li>Use log likelihood</li>
<li>Use CV and/or IC</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>So that about wraps it up!</p>

<title>The Pragmatic Programmer</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>I read the original <a href="https://pragprog.com/titles/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition/">Pragmatic Programmer</a> years ago, and now read
the 20th anniversary edition with some of my colleagues. It was an
important book to me early in my career, and still has lots of useful
reminders and updates with the new edition.</p>
<p>I wish the whole book was available as pages on the public web. It's
"written as a series of self-contained sections" in a way that would
work really well with hyperlinks.</p>

<h3><a name="ch1"></a>Chapter 1: A Pragmatic Philosophy</h3>
<hr>
<p>The "broken windows" terminology hasn't aged terribly well because of
the controversy around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory">broken windows policing</a>; I agree broadly
with the software development message, but the term has some unwanted
connotations.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Tip 9: Invest Regularly in Your Knowledge Portfolio" (page 15)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The "Knowledge Portfolio" metaphor is pretty good. I also want people
to be life-long knowledge investors.</p>
<p>They list five items in managing a knowledge portfolio:</p>
<ul>
<li>Invest regularly</li>
<li>Diversify</li>
<li>Manage risk</li>
<li>Buy low, sell high</li>
<li>Review and rebalance</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<hr>
<h3><a name="ch2"></a>Chapter 2: A Pragmatic Approach</h3>
<hr>
<p>They note "Meyer's <em>Uniform Access principle</em>," which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_access_principle">states</a> that
"All services offered by a module should be available through a
uniform notation, which does not betray whether they are implemented
through storage or through computation."</p>
<p>In Python this doesn't have to mean exposing getters and setters;
using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#property">@property</a> is a good solution.</p>

<p>How? How do they do footnotes, etc.? Sounds like ConTeXt can do some
part... But presumably they have their own custom stuff. Lots of
details, I imagine.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Model building can be both creative and useful in the long term.
Often, the process of building the model leads to discoveries of
underlying patterns and processes that weren't apparent on the

<hr>
<h3><a name="ch3"></a>Chapter 3: The Basic Tools</h3>
<hr>
<p>The footnote on page 100 cites <a href="http://pignottia.faculty.mjc.edu/math134/homework/doodlingCaseStudy.pdf">What Does Doodling do?</a>, which seems
kind of neat. I don't completely trust the result in the paper though,
or at least the interpretation. Here's the abstract:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Doodling is a way of passing the time when bored by a lecture or
telephone call. Does it improve or hinder attention to the primary
task? To answer this question, 40 participants monitored a
monotonous mock telephone message for the names of people coming to
a party. Half of the group was randomly assigned to a &#8216;doodling&#8217;
condition where they shaded printed shapes while listening to the
telephone call. The doodling group performed better on the
monitoring task and recalled 29% more information on a surprise
memory test. Unlike many dual task situations, doodling while
working can be beneficial. Future research could test whether
doodling aids cognitive performance by reducing daydreaming</p>

<h3><a name="ch4"></a>Chapter 4: Pragmatic Paranoia</h3>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"DBC [Design By Contract] is more efficient (and DRY-er) than

<hr>
<h3><a name="ch5"></a>Chapter 5: Bend, or Break</h3>
<p>This chapter is <em>very substantially</em> different from the original
version, and in interesting ways. Here's a quick summary of the

<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"[Concurrency] is often implemented using things such as fibers,
threads, and processes." (page 169)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wasn't familiar with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber_(computer_science)">fibers</a>. Cute name. Connected to coroutines
(cooperative multitasking). Seems like fibers is common terminology in
Ruby.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"... messaging systems (such as Kafka and NATS)" (page 189)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wasn't familiar with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATS_Messaging">NATS</a>. It's a messaging system. According
the <a href="https://docs.nats.io/faq">FAQ</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"NATS stands for Neural Autonomic Transport System. Derek Collison
conceived NATS as a messaging platform that functions like a central
nervous system."</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h3><a name="ch7"></a>Chapter 7: While You Are Coding</h3>
<hr>
<p>"Testing is not about finding bugs, it&#8217;s about getting feedback on
your code: aspects of design, the API, coupling, and so on. That means
that the major benefits of testing happen when you think about and
write the tests, not just when you run them." (page 325)</p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="ch8"></a>Chapter 8: Before the Project</h3>
<p>This is good stuff, but I didn't pull out specific notes. It's on
working in tight feedback loops rather than trying to "collect
requirements" all at the beginning.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="ch9"></a>Chapter 9: Pragmatic Projects</h3>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Programmers are a bit like cats: intelligent, strong willed,
opinionated, independent, and often worshiped by the net." (page
437)</p>
</blockquote>

</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324959836_Mythical_Unit_Test_Coverage">Mythical Unit Test Coverage</a>
is neat. Abstract:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is a continuous struggle to understand how much a product should
be tested before its delivery to the market. Ericsson, as a global
software development company, decided to evaluate the adequacy of
the unit-test-coverage criterion that it had employed for years as a
guide for sufficiency of testing. Naturally, one can think that if
increasing coverage decreases the number of defects significantly,
then coverage can be considered a criterion for test sufficiency. To
test this hypothesis in practice, we investigated the relationship
of unit-test-coverage measures and post-unit-test defects in a large
commercial product of Ericsson. The results indicate that high
unit-test coverage did not seem to be any tangible help in producing
defect-free software."</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Even though your title might be some variation of &#8220;Software
Developer&#8221; or &#8220;Software Engineer,&#8221; in truth it should be &#8220;Problem
Solver.&#8221; That&#8217;s what we do, and that&#8217;s the essence of a Pragmatic
Programmer. We solve problems." (page 464)</p>

ground for sloppiness, mistakes, sloth, and bad code." (page 466)</p>
