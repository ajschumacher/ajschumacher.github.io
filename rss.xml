<title>Noise, by Kahneman, Sibony, and Sunstein</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p><a href="/2011/12/17/selections-from-and-thoughts-on/">Thinking, Fast and Slow</a> was about bias, and now <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise:_A_Flaw_in_Human_Judgment">Noise</a> is about
variance. It even opens with the classic two-by-two accuracy and
precision bullseye <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias%E2%80%93variance_tradeoff#Motivation">illustration</a>. But the book is really about how
people are systematically different from one another. The book
considers federated systems in which work items are assigned to
different people, and concludes that most of the "variance" comes from
stable differences between those people.</p>
<p><img alt="breakdown" src="breakdown.jpg"></p>
<p>(I am a fan of the <a href="/20201030-the_variance_sum_law_is_interesting/">variance sum law</a>.)</p>
<p>In the book's phrasing, "system noise" is variance in outcomes,
distinct from bias. System noise is the sum of "level noise," which is
stable differences in average outcomes per person - "strict judge vs.
lenient judge" - and "stable pattern noise," which is stable
differences in how individuals are overfit, in the ML sense, - "Bob's
generally strict but always lenient with young mothers" - and
"occasion noise," which is true repeat-performance noise based on
randomness from somewhere (conditions, etc.).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>while the existence of occasion noise is surprising and even
disturbing, there is no indication that within-person variability is
larger than between-person differences. The most important component
of system noise is the one we had initially neglected: stable
pattern noise, the variability among judges in their judgments of
particular cases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Note also that "level noise" can be properly thought of as just an
average over "pattern noise" - I'm not sure it's correct to treat it
separately.)</p>
<p>The challenge, not sufficiently addressed, in my opinion, is that
removing this "noise" requires not just choosing one answer to be the
right one, but convincing the people involved. This is a societal
challenge. Whatever level of strictness or leniency you choose, for
the judges, some judges will disagree.</p>
<p>I think Kahneman neglects the extent to which systems exist through
false consensus: It isn't possible to get everyone to agree on the
details, so the system has to be made vague enough that everyone can
<em>think</em> it says what they want. Then they can go on having differences
of opinion.</p>
<p>Not that this is good, exactly. It's politics.</p>
<p>And Kahneman does talk about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Na%C3%AFve_realism_(psychology)">naïve realism</a> and the illusion of
agreement, so this idea isn't totally absent from the book. But just
like hand-washing took (and takes) surprisingly much effort, there's a
big gap between <em>having</em> a Gawande-style checklist and getting it
accepted and followed, for example.</p>
<p>There were interesting bits about how groups can have opposite
effects: Averaging independent outcomes can decrease noise, but
discussion can actually amplify noise. They recommend techniques like
"estimate-talk-estimate" to try to get positive effects.</p>
<p>Kahneman also emphasizes "percent concordant" and always includes it
with correlation coefficients. This is exactly the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_of_superiority">Common Language Effect Size</a> which goes by many names. I'm a fan!
Glad to have Kahneman supporting this here. It sure would be nice if
it went from zero to one though.</p>
<p>Another interesting topic is what Kahneman calls “objective ignorance”
and is very tightly related to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes_error_rate">Bayes error rate</a> or
"irreducible error." It made me wonder, when we're talking about
variance explained, if 60% is "irreducible," then maybe explaining 20%
is quite a strong result, actually. Unclear how to be quite confident
about this kind of thing though. Bad news for <a href="/20200714-foundation_trilogy/">psychohistory</a> too.
(How much is chaos?)</p>
<p>Kahneman chastises people for feeling they're 80% confident about a
given decision if they'll only be right 60% of the time. But there's a
difference he ignores, I think: You could be 80% confident that you
made the best possible decision given your information at the time,
and still be right just 60% of the time. Those can be consistent.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/sds/docs/dawes/the-robust-beauty-of-improper-linear-models-in-decision-making.pdf">The Robust Beauty of Improper Linear Models in Decision Making</a>
(just give everything equal weight) is interesting. I wonder whether
some big chunk of AI "success" will essentially come from this kind of
effect, just the benefit of statistical instead of clinical judgement,
but the fanciness of AI will make it more palatable.</p>
<p>There's bits on incorporating the base rate, which feels like being
Bayesian. Don't overfit, etc. And be actively open-minded.</p>
<p>What is the right way to average predictions of superforecasters? Is
it just simple arithmetic mean? Or is it some other mean that works
best?</p>
<p>Long ago I was in a start-up that didn't do annual performance
reviews. I thought it was radical and great. So it was interesting to
hear that apparently more companies are moving away from annual
performance reviews.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And if your goal is to bring out the best in people, you can
reasonably ask whether measuring individual performance and using
that measurement to motivate people through fear and greed is the
best approach (or even an effective one).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The book finishes out with some discussion of rules vs. standards,
where rules are more mechanical and standards still allow some
discussion while being more prescriptive than just principles.</p>
<p><img alt="cover" src="cover.jpg"></p>
<h3>Six principles of decision hygiene</h3>
<ol>
<li>The goal of judgment is accuracy, not individual expression.</li>
<li>Think statistically, and take the outside view of the case.</li>
<li>Structure judgments into several independent tasks.</li>
<li>Resist premature intuitions.</li>
<li>Obtain independent judgments from multiple judges, then consider
aggregating those judgments.</li>
<li>Favor relative judgments and relative scales.</li>
</ol>

<title>The Psychology of Money, by Housel</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>Housel had a <a href="https://collabfund.com/blog/the-psychology-of-money/">blog post</a> in 2018, and it was big enough that it
became a <a href="https://planetone.online/downloads/others/books/The_Psychology_of_Money.pdf">book</a> in 2020. It's wild how many books come about that
way now; it's like your proposal has to go viral before you get a book
deal.</p>
<p>The blog post and book are structured similarly <em>enough</em> that I think
it's interesting to compare them.</p>
<p>The blog post was a list of 20 items. I think 7 of them don't really
appear in the book at all, perhaps because they're too wonky or
specific:</p>
<ul>
<li>(9) Attachment to social proof in a field that demands contrarian
   thinking to achieve above-average results.</li>
<li>(10) An appeal to academia in a field that is governed not by clean
   rules but loose and unpredictable trends.</li>
<li>(12) A tendency toward action in a field where the first rule of
   compounding is to never interrupt it unnecessarily.</li>
<li>(15) An attachment to financial entertainment due to the fact that
   money is emotional, and emotions are revved up by argument, extreme
   views, flashing lights, and threats to your wellbeing.</li>
<li>(17) A preference for skills in a field where skills don’t matter
   if they aren’t matched with the right behavior.</li>
<li>(19) Political beliefs driving financial decisions, influenced by
   economics being a misbehaved cousin of politics.</li>
<li>(20) The three-month bubble: Extrapolating the recent past into the
   near future, and then overestimating the extent to which whatever
   you anticipate will happen in the near future will impact your
   future.</li>
</ul>
<p>The book, then, has 18 items: 13 from the blog post's list, and 5 that
are new (at least new as whole sections). The book has an intro, and
two other chapters in which are a summary and a breakdown of the
author's personal money choices, and then there's a postscript with
his "brief history of why the U.S. consumer thinks the way they do,"
which is something like "after WWII people got used to a little bit of
equality and a little bit of debt, and now they're using too much debt
to try to get back a little bit of equality".</p>
<p>Here are the book's chapters, with blog equivalents (original blog
post numbering in parens) and notes:</p>
<ol>
<li>No One's Crazy: Your personal experiences with money make up maybe
   0.00000001% of what's happened in the world, but maybe 80% of how
   you think the world works.<ul>
<li>(5) Anchored-to-your-own-history bias: Your personal experiences
  make up maybe 0.00000001% of what’s happened in the world but
  maybe 80% of how you think the world works.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Luck &amp; Risk: Nothing is as good or as bad as it seems.<ul>
<li>(1) Earned success and deserved failure fallacy: A tendency to
  underestimate the role of luck and risk, and a failure to
  recognize that luck and risk are different sides of the same
  coin.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Never Enough: When rich people do crazy things.<ul>
<li>This is the first new section, and it's about greed, in fairly
  extreme cases where successful people were found to have
  committed fraud even when you wouldn't think they'd need to. I
  think the section has noble intent but fails because (a) you
  have to believe that these people's <em>earlier</em> success was
  non-fraudulent, which is suspect (Madoff's earlier "success" was
  based on payment for order flow, it seems, which is illegal in
  Canada and disliked by many in the US) and (b) the general theme
  of avarice need not go so far as fraud to be worthwhile. See,
  for example, <a href="/20251123-your_money_or_your_life/">Your money or your life</a>. On the other hand,
  maybe it's easier to talk about greed with extreme cases so that
  the reader can safely revile them without finding them familiar.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Confounding Compounding: $81.5 billion of Warren Buffett's $84.5
   billion net worth came after his 65th birthday. Our minds are not
   built to handle such absurdities.<ul>
<li>(8) Underappreciating the power of compounding, driven by the
  tendency to intuitively think about exponential growth in linear
  terms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Getting Wealthy vs. Staying Wealthy: Good investing is not
   necessarily about making good decisions. It's about consistently
   not screwing up.<ul>
<li>(16) Optimism bias in risk-taking, or “Russian Roulette should
  statistically work” syndrome: An over attachment to favorable
  odds when the downside is unacceptable in any circumstance.</li>
<li>This one is tangled up with 13, and indeed includes "the most
  important part of every plan is to plan on the plan not going
  according to plan" here too. The distinction, perhaps, is about
  not actively <em>doing</em> things that risk ruining you, as opposed to
  defensively <em>protecting yourself</em> from outside forces ruining
  you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tails, You Win: You can be wrong half the time and still make a
   fortune.<ul>
<li>This is a new one, about making lots of bets. Assuming no bet
  can kill you, you only need a minority of them to do really well
  in order to win.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Freedom: Controlling your time is the highest dividend money pays.<ul>
<li>This appeared in the blog post in passing ("A key use of wealth
  is using it to control your time") but it's grown into a whole
  section and maybe even a theme in the book.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Man in the Car Paradox: No one is impressed with your possessions
   as much as you are.<ul>
<li>(3) Rich man in the car paradox</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Wealth is What You Don't See: Spending money to show people how
   much money you have is the fastest way to have less money.<ul>
<li>(11) The social utility of money coming at the direct expense of
  growing money; wealth is what you don’t see.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Save Money: The only factor you can control generates one of the
    only things that matters. How wonderful.<ul>
<li>Also new, and quite explicitly advice.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reasonable &gt; Rational: Aiming to be mostly reasonable works better
    than trying to be coldly rational.<ul>
<li>There's some of the "avoid Russian roulette" idea here, but this
  is mostly new... It's a little bit like how the "snowball
  method" of paying off small debts first is often a bad idea
  financially - unless doing it that way makes the difference
  between paying off debt and not doing so. Also sort of related
  to the idea of knowing the price of things: there can be a
  psychological price, which can be meaningful for an individual.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Surprise! History is the study of change, ironically used as a map
    of the future.<ul>
<li>(6) Historians are Prophets fallacy: Not seeing the irony that
  history is the study of surprises and changes while using it as
  a guide to the future. An overreliance on past data as a signal
  to future conditions in a field where innovation and change is
  the lifeblood of progress.</li>
<li>Vonnegut: “History is merely a list of surprises,' I said. 'It
  can only prepare us to be surprised yet again. Please write that
  down.” Housel has written it down.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Room for Error: The most important part of every plan is planning
    on your plan not going according to plan.<ul>
<li>(13) Underestimating the need for room for error, not just
  financially but mentally and physically.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You'll Change: Long-term planning is harder than it seems because
    people's goals and desires change over time.<ul>
<li>(4) A tendency to adjust to current circumstances in a way that
  makes forecasting your future desires and actions difficult,
  resulting in the inability to capture long-term compounding
  rewards that come from current decisions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Nothing's Free: Everything has a price, but not all prices appear
    on labels.<ul>
<li>(2) Cost avoidance syndrome: A failure to identify the true
  costs of a situation, with too much emphasis on financial costs
  while ignoring the emotional price that must be paid to win a
  reward.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You &amp; Me: Beware taking financial cues from people playing a
    different game than you are.<ul>
<li>(14) A tendency to be influenced by the actions of other people
  who are playing a different financial game than you are.</li>
<li>He's talking about bubbles. People driving up bubbles are not
  long-term investors, he says.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Seduction of Pessimism: Optimism sounds like a sales pitch.
    Pessimism sounds like someone trying to help you.<ul>
<li>(7) The seduction of pessimism in a world where optimism is the
  most reasonable stance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When You'll Believe Anything: Appealing fictions, and why stories
    are more powerful than statistics.<ul>
<li>(18) Denial of inconsistencies between how you think the world
  should work and how the world actually works, driven by a desire
  to form a clean narrative of cause and effect despite the
  inherent complexities of everything involving money.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All Together Now: What we've learned about the psychology of your
    own money.<ul>
<li>This is just a summary, as the heading suggests.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Confessions: The psychology of my own money.<ul>
<li>And here the author describes his own money choices, which I
  find reasonable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It's not all great, but it's not bad. Mostly reasonable advice, I
think. I feel like I agree with this guy. The repeated focus on
<em>survival,</em> for example, fits well with my ongoing vendetta against
expected value as the be-all and end-all of decision-making.</p>
<p><img alt="cover" src="cover.png"></p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Most of the reason why, I believe, is that we think about and are
taught about money in ways that are too much like physics (with
rules and laws) and not enough like psychology (with emotions and
nuance).</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Someone else agreeing with you is like evidence of being right that
doesn’t have to prove itself with facts.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Money has competition, rules, upsets, wins, losses, heroes,
villains, teams, and fans that makes it tantalizingly close to a
sporting event.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Everyone just believes what they want to believe, even when the
evidence shows something else. Stories over statistics.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>The New York Times wrote in 1955 about the growing desire, but
continued inability, to retire: “To rephrase an old saying: everyone
talks about retirement, but apparently very few do anything about
it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Mr. Madoff’s firm can execute trades so quickly and cheaply that it
actually pays other brokerage firms a penny a share to execute their
customers’ orders, profiting from the spread between bid and ask
prices that most stocks trade for.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>The End of History Illusion is what psychologists call the tendency
for people to be keenly aware of how much they’ve changed in the
past, but to underestimate how much their personalities, desires,
and goals are likely to change in the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Jason Zweig, the Wall Street Journal investment columnist, worked
with psychologist Daniel Kahneman on writing Kahneman’s book
Thinking, Fast and Slow. Zweig once told a story about a personality
quirk of Kahneman’s that served him well: “Nothing amazed me more
about Danny than his ability to detonate what we had just done,”
Zweig wrote. He and Kahneman could work endlessly on a chapter, but:</p>
<p>The next thing you know, [Kahneman] sends a version so utterly
transformed that it is unrecognizable: It begins differently, it
ends differently, it incorporates anecdotes and evidence you never
would have thought of, it draws on research that you’ve never heard
of.</p>
<p>“When I asked Danny how he could start again as if we had never
written an earlier draft,” Zweig continued, “he said the words I’ve
never forgotten: ‘I have no sunk costs.’”</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Bubbles form when the momentum of short-term returns attracts enough
money that the makeup of investors shifts from mostly long term to
mostly short term.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>And since big events come out of nowhere, forecasts may do more harm
than good, giving the illusion of predictability in a world where
unforeseen events control most outcomes.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>We’re so far committed to the independence camp that we’ve done
things that make little sense on paper. We own our house without a
mortgage, which is the worst financial decision we’ve ever made but
the best money decision we’ve ever made. Mortgage interest rates
were absurdly low when we bought our house. Any rational advisor
would recommend taking advantage of cheap money and investing extra
savings in higher-return assets, like stocks. But our goal isn’t to
be coldly rational; just psychologically reasonable.</p>
<p>The independent feeling I get from owning our house outright far
exceeds the known financial gain I’d get from leveraging our assets
with a cheap mortgage. Eliminating the monthly payment feels better
than maximizing the long-term value of our assets. It makes me feel
independent. I don’t try to defend this decision to those pointing
out its flaws, or those who would never do the same. On paper it’s
defenseless. But it works for us. We like it. That’s what matters.
Good decisions aren’t always rational. At some point you have to
choose between being happy or being “right.”</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>One of my deeply held investing beliefs is that there is little
correlation between investment effort and investment results.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Benedict Evans says, “The more the Internet exposes people to new
points of view, the angrier people get that different views exist.”</p>

<p>Lots more detail on <a href="https://www.amazon.jobs/content/en/our-workplace/leadership-principles">Amazon's page</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Former:</p>
<ul>
<li>Innovation (added to the initial core principles, circa 1998)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>I don't know any company that's as into a set of principles as Amazon
is. See <a href="/20210903-working_backwards_by_bryar_and_carr/">Working Backwards</a>, for example, on how they're deeply
integrated into hiring and performance review processes.</p>
<p>The Leadership Principles started as company core principles in 1998,
part of spreading Amazon culture across newly acquired companies.
("Customer Obsession" might be considered to precede even this list,
as it was sort of a founding ethos of Amazon.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amazon’s purchase of Telebuch in Germany and BookPages in the UK in
1998 gave Bezos an opportunity to articulate the company’s core
principles. Alison Algore, a D. E. Shaw transplant who worked in
human resources, pondered Amazon’s values with Bezos as he prepared
for an introductory conference call with the Telebuch founders. They
agreed on five core values and wrote them down on a whiteboard in a
conference room: <em>customer obsession, frugality, bias for action,
ownership,</em> and <em>high bar for talent.</em> Later Amazon would add a
sixth value, innovation. (from <a href="https://prachititg.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/the-everything-store-jeff-bezos-and-the-age-of-amazon.pdf">The Everything Store</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Leadership Principles appeared with that name at some point in the
early 2000s, though I haven't been able to lock down precise details
on this. It seems they were fairly stable as a list of 13 principles
from the early 2000s until 2015.</p>
<p>Leadership Principle 5 was <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/executive-insights/content/leading-and-innovating-with-leadership-principles/">added</a> in 2015.</p>
<p>In 2021, Amazon
<a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/two-new-leadership-principles">added</a>
Leadership Principles 15 and 16 as Andy Jassy was becoming CEO.</p>
<hr>
<p>It sounds like teams at Amazon also often have around five or six
"<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5raEKA57PMY">tenets</a>," which are about what the team aims to be and do. This
<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90334069/these-are-amazons-38-rules-for-success">article</a> includes Amazon HR's tenets, for example.</p>
<hr>
<p>That same <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90334069/these-are-amazons-38-rules-for-success">article</a> has a list of ways that Amazon is peculiar, in
their parlance. (There's a mascot named <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90329525/amazon-peccy">Peccy</a>!)</p>

<title>(Audio) Your money or your life, by Robin and Dominguez</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p><a href="https://files.addictbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Your-Money-or-Your-Life.pdf">This</a> is the 2018 revised edition, not the 1992 original, but it's
still arguably the antecedent to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIRE_movement">FIRE</a> (Financial Independence,
Retire Early) movement and now even features a foreword from
<a href="https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/">Mr. Money Mustache</a>. It's a nine-step program.</p>
<ol>
<li>Figure out how much money you've earned in your whole life, and
   your current net worth.</li>
<li>Figure out your "real hourly wage," and track all your income and
   spending.</li>
<li>Catalog monthly spending into custom categories for you.</li>
<li>Evaluate how you feel about your spending, by category.</li>
<li>Make a monthly chart tracking your income and spending.</li>
<li>Minimize spending.</li>
<li>Maximize income.</li>
<li>Accumulate money toward a crossover point where you can live on
   investment income.</li>
<li>Invest in fairly boring ways to generate income you can live on.</li>
</ol>
<p>It's reasonable advice and I generally agree. I was a little surprised
by the extent to which the book is really "degrowth," in the sense of
<a href="/20240519-survival_of_the_richest_by_rushkoff/">Rushkoff</a>. It's really not about "fat FIRE," but about
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_living">simple living</a>, or voluntary simplicity, not just as an expedient
for retirement, but as a moral-environmental imperative.</p>
<p>I liked how <a href="/20241116-weve_got_you_covered_by_einav_and_finkelstein/">We've got you covered</a> was very clear about the
decision inherent in health insurance about what to cover versus not
cover. This book is clear about the decision regarding how much is
"enough" spending for life in general.</p>
<p>I think the choice about how much is "enough" is interesting as a
personal choice, and also an interesting topic in connection with
<a href="/20240921-fully_automated_luxury_communism_by_bastani/">Fully Automated Luxury Communism</a>. (What level of luxury?) I don't
think this figure ("The Fulfillment Curve") is super great though:</p>
<p><img src="fulfillment.jpg" width="480px"></p>
<p>The justification in the text is that people report similar
"fulfillment" across a wide range of incomes, and that at some point
you get more "clutter" than real fulfillment. I don't think it's
<em>completely</em> wrong, but it's close. I feel like there could be
something here about finding fulfillment in better ways, living in
community and participating in the work that supports that community,
equality being healthier than subjugation of the poor by the rich,
that kind of thing. But at the very least this kind of claim needs
more evidence and fewer headstones tossed on the graph.</p>
<p>It's a fine book with a distinct voice. It talks about "consciousness"
and "life energy" constantly. It says that since you spend time
earning money, money is equivalent with "life energy," which kind of
works in the framework of the book but doesn't raise to the next
natural level, as a critique of the conditions of capitalism.</p>
<p>The author is also into "<a href="http://conversationcafe.org/">conversation café</a>s," which seem like they
could be neat.</p>

<title>(Audio) Breakneck, by Dan Wang</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>It's about China as contrasted with the US, mostly via critiques as in
<a href="/20251120-abundance_klein_thompson/">Abundance</a>. The US is "the lawyerly society" and China is "the
engineering state," and while the one child and zero covid policies
are criticized (for example) the eventual recommendation is to be more
like China, more like Robert Moses.</p>
<hr>
<p>I learned about China's "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Party_(China)">Industrial Party</a>," which is interesting.
Sort of techno-optimism as a nationalist prescription.</p>
<p>Does anybody else remember Vonnegut's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slapstick_(novel)">Slapstick</a>? In which "Western
civilization is nearing collapse as oil runs out, and the Chinese are
making vast leaps forward by miniaturizing themselves and training
groups of hundreds to think as one. Eventually, the miniaturization
proceeds to the point that the Chinese become so small they cause a
plague among those who accidentally inhale them, ultimately destroying
Western civilization beyond repair."</p>
<hr>
<p>There's some interesting stuff about process knowledge and encouraging
communities of practice. I don't know whether this is what makes
Shenzhen successful, or whether the lack of it is what's troubled
Boeing, but I agree that process knowledge is <em>something</em> and that
it's too often ignored or undervalued.</p>
<p>Is Boeing's problem really loss of process knowledge, or is the
problem too much belief in the Friedman doctrine, too much blind focus
on near-term profit?</p>
<hr>
<p>I tried to find where Heidegger said that philosophy was dying, to be
replaced with cybernetics, and it seems to be
<a href="https://grattoncourses.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/22the-end-of-philosophy-and-the-task-of-thinking22.pdf">The End of Philosophy and the Task of Thinking</a>. How could anyone
ever be taken seriously who wrote like this?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Only a country ruled by engineers could be so single-minded about
pursuing a number. (page 123)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This reminds me of <a href="/20200425-tyranny_of_metrics_by_muller/">The Tyranny of Metrics</a>, and the kind of cynical
"data driven" perversions you can find in industry.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>In the United States, physics and mathematics PhDs hardly have a
chance to consider working in their field before a tech giant or
hedge fund picks them up at the sidelines of a conference, flashes
them with a humongous pay package, and folds these eager minds into
their glamorous embrace. Senior government advisers have more or
less stated that Beijing intends to block these temptations. Yao
Yang, a dean at Peking University, has remarked with satisfaction
that salaries have fallen in the financial industry after regulators
imposed a salary cap of $400,000 on the financial sector. Its idea,
Yao said, “is to reduce the attractiveness of finance and to
increase the development of manufacturing.” (page 162)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This reminds me of Jeff Hammerbacher's quote, "The best minds of my
generation are thinking about how to make people click ads. That
sucks."</p>

<title>(Audio) Abundance, by Klein and Thompson</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>I started listening to Dunkelman's <a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/marc-j-dunkelman/why-nothing-works/9781541700215/">Why Nothing Works</a>, but
abandoned it. Ezra Klein's name, I think, is why I made it through the
similar <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abundance_(Klein_and_Thompson_book)">Abundance</a>. Crazy culturally mediated world.</p>
<p>I was very pleased that Klein explicitly references
<a href="/20240921-fully_automated_luxury_communism_by_bastani/">Fully Automated Luxury Communism</a>. <a href="https://wwnorton.com/books/9781324106036">Breakneck</a> turns out to be
substantially similar to Abundance as well, and references it. The
general vibe has been in the air.</p>
<p>The vibe is: Regulate less, build more. Less restriction, more
expansion. Less red tape, more research.</p>
<p>This requires giving government more room to act, which makes sense if
the government is going to do the right things. Power is needed to do
big things, but its tendency to corrupt may still be an issue.</p>
<p>Some interesting references: <a href="https://homelessnesshousingproblem.com/">Homelessness is a housing problem.</a>
<a href="https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/">WTF Happened In 1971?</a> Apparently the US has four times as many
lawyers per capita as France.</p>
<p>There are hints of <a href="/20221105-why_greatness_cannot_be_planned_by_stanley_and_lehman/">Why greatness cannot be planned</a> in Thompson's
second half on science and technology. It makes me wonder about the
limits of fully federated action, as opposed to central control. What
truly requires the power of a government, a university?</p>
<p><img alt="cover" src="cover.jpg"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just as feudalism blocked production that only capitalism could
unleash, so did capitalism constrain an abundance that a new
paradigm might unleash. Core to this analysis of the economy was an
idea that has come to be called the “fettering of production.” Marx
observed that many companies’ obsession with profit kept the entire
economy from exploring ideas that threatened incumbent margins or
failed to produce immediate returns. Among capitalism’s many sins,
Marx wrote, was that it prevented the most wondrous and useful
technology from being invented and deployed in the first place. An
economy run amok with useless fettering serves the rich few at the
expense of the poorer many. (page 127)</p>

<title>Radically condensed instructions for being just as you are</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>This funny little <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/165080210/Radically-Condensed-Instructions-for-Bei-Matthews-J-Jennifer">book</a> was mentioned in <a href="/20250921-four_thousand_weeks_by_burkeman/">Four Thousand Weeks</a>.
It's on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondualism">nonduality</a>. The title joke seems to be that usually people
say even more, writing on this topic, when arguably not much needs to
be said. There are still pretty many words here, and many of them are
"poignancy."</p>
<p>My personal philosophy has some affinity with this nondualism stuff.
My starting point is that experience is the only thing we have direct
experience of. Nondualists seem to argue that this should be both
starting point and ending point. I'm all about living in the moment
and all, but I tend to feel that just because we can't prove things
exist, it doesn't mean we shouldn't believe that they do. But it's
okay to grant that this is a leap.</p>
<p>There's some cute discussion of how trying too hard to live in the
moment is a good way to take yourself out of the moment. I think this
is kind of like falling asleep: trying to make yourself fall asleep is
stressful. You have to relax, and again, you don't relax by trying
hard to relax. Also like meditating, where you aim to let thoughts
come and let them go, not by trying hard to do this, but by not
trying. So we have a "philosophy of not-philosophy," and a perfect
practitioner doesn't need to read this book. I'm not sure the
comparison is perfect, but it reminds me of Star Wars: "I don't know;
fly casual."</p>
<p>Thinking about this more, I wonder if what <a href="/20250921-four_thousand_weeks_by_burkeman/">Four Thousand Weeks</a> is
really trying to offer is a time management of not-time-management.
The idea that you shouldn't be trying to manage time, but that you
should be living and doing things without worrying about the time
management. I think there's something here: getting in the flow of
doing something, not focusing on planning but on doing, etc. This
feels like a better interpretation of <a href="/20250921-four_thousand_weeks_by_burkeman/">Four Thousand Weeks</a> than I
had previously given it. (Maybe better than it really deserves...)</p>
<p>Anyway, sure, cute short book.</p>

<title>Four Thousand Weeks, by Burkeman</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<blockquote>
<p>“You could think of this book as an extended argument for the
empowering potential of giving up hope.” (page 231)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Burkeman's subtitle is "Time Management for Mortals," but the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Thousand_Weeks:_Time_Management_for_Mortals">book</a>
is mostly (though not entirely) opposed to time management. Some
advice is decent, but the core focus on mortality is dead on arrival.
The book is fairly incoherent as a whole, but it has made me think.</p>
<p>The author has many critiques of (other) productivity books. These
critiques are mostly wrong or exaggerated. One that I did find
meaningful was that often productivity is tied to the false belief
that things that aren't measured aren't valuable, as in
<a href="/20200425-tyranny_of_metrics_by_muller/">The Tyranny of Metrics</a>. This makes "productivity" sort of
self-centered, often; it isn't "productive" to volunteer, or engage in
civic life generally, to know local issues, to vote. This kind of
measurement-obsessed productivity, usually implicitly career-oriented,
becomes a misdirection of energy.</p>
<p>Burkeman accuses productivity advice of being unsustainable, but comes
down too far in the other direction, as if noting that it isn't
possible to sprint forever before concluding that all attempts to
cover distance are futile. This feels like the common tension between
accepting things exactly as they are as opposed to hating things as
they are and pushing to change them at all costs. As usual, neither
extreme is really great.</p>
<p>Burkeman wants you to live in the moment, which I tend to support as
well, but I don't agree with the reasoning having to come from
mortality. Fear of death can't really make you live in the moment;
death is in the future. Infinite life also wouldn't mean that choices
become meaningless; you would still have only one walk through the
garden of forking paths. Yes, value every moment—but not out of fear.
Not out of a scarcity mindset.</p>
<p><img alt="cover" src="cover.jpg"></p>
<hr>
<p>Burkeman references Seneca's <a href="/20240105-seneca_de_brevitate_vitae/">De Brevitate Vitae</a> on page four. I
think at some point he mentioned <a href="/20201107-how_to_live_on_24_hours_a_day/">How to Live on 24 Hours a Day</a> as
well.</p>
<hr>
<p>On page eight Burkeman mentions three productivity books:
<a href="/2011/03/14/listened-to-four-hour-work-week/">The Four-Hour Work Week</a>, <a href="/20220327-smarter_faster_better_by_duhigg/">Smarter, Faster, Better</a>, and Extreme
Productivity. I've read the first two, and after looking briefly into
the last, it looks like all of them in fact do talk a lot about
prioritizing and saying "no" to things. Burkeman's characterization of
the productivity literature as somehow ignoring this seems unfair.</p>
<hr>
<p>Burkeman says on page nine that productivity works but makes us feel
busier. This has not been my experience. I feel less stress when
things are managed, and I'm able to confidently know that I've taken
care of what I needed to.</p>
<p>Some large chunk of good time management is just memory aids, I think:
Ways of organizing things so that they don't fall through the cracks
and create stressful problems later.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>This struggle against the distressing constraints of reality is what
some old-school psychoanalysts call "neurosis," and it takes
countless forms, from workaholism and commitment-phobia to
codependency and chronic shyness.</p>
<p>Our troubled relationship with time arises largely from the same
effort to avoid the painful constraints of reality. (page 30)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is an interesting characterization of neurosis, especially when
considered along with psychosis, in which neurosis is sort of fighting
against (or worrying about) reality, while psychosis is instead a
clear break with reality.</p>
<p>I'm not sure that's what people usually think of when they think
"neurosis," but it's kind of neat.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>... I wrote this book for myself, as much as for anyone else,
putting my faith in the words of the author Richard Bach: "You teach
best what you most need to learn." (page 33)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Bach">Richard Bach</a> and his books including <em>Jonathan Livingston
Seagull</em> were apparently quite big in the 70s.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Think of it as “existential overwhelm”: the modern world provides an
inexhaustible supply of things that seem worth doing, and so there
arises an inevitable and unbridgeable gap between what you'd ideally
like to do and what you actually can do. (page 45)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>The harder you struggle to fit everything in, the more of your time
you'll find yourself spending on the least meaningful things. Adopt
an ultra-ambitious time management system that promises to take care
of your entire to-do list, and you probably won't even get around to
the most important items on that list. Dedicate your retirement to
seeing as much of the world as you possibly can, and you probably
won't even get to see the most interesting parts. (page 48)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is ridiculous. Maybe this is where his whole argument falls
apart. It's just not true that you have to do everything, and I think
this passage illustrates the silliness of it. Who would literally aim
to see "as much of the world as you possibly can" and have that mean
devoting equal time to every square inch? For his claims here to make
any sense you have to imagine both having overwhelming and
indiscriminate FOMO and absolutely no sense of prioritization. Both
are problems to resolve, not axioms to reason from.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>The most fundamental thing we fail to appreciate about the world,
Heidegger asserts in his magnum opus, <em>Being and Time,</em> is how
bafflingly astonishing it is that it’s there at all – the fact that
there is anything rather than nothing. Most philosophers and
scientists spend their careers pondering the <em>way</em> things are: what
sorts of things exist, where they come from, how they relate to each
other, and so on. But we’ve forgotten to be amazed <em>that</em> things are
in the first place – that ‘a world is worlding all around us’, as
Heidegger puts it. This fact – the fact that <em>there is being,</em> to
begin with – is ‘the brute reality on which all of us ought to be
constantly stubbing our toes’, in the splendid phrase of the writer
Sarah Bakewell. But instead, it almost always passes us by. (page
58)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I sometimes think a related thing, paraphrasing Descartes, "I think,
therefore something is going on." I tend to identify with this
Heidegger snippet. Existence is a miracle.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>In his 2019 book, This Life, the Swedish philosopher Martin Hägglund
makes this all a bit clearer and less mystical by juxtaposing the
idea of facing our finitude with the religious belief in an eternal
life. If you really thought life would never end, he argues, then
nothing could ever genuinely matter, because you’d never be faced
with having to decide whether or not to use a portion of your
precious life on something. ‘If I believed that my life would last
forever,’ Hägglund writes, ‘I could never take my life to be at
stake, and I would never be seized by the need to do anything with
my time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This Hägglund may have some worthwhile things to say, but I think that
like Burkeman he's wrong to focus so much on death as the most
important thing, and wrong that without death nothing would matter.</p>
<p>I hear Hägglund is critical of capitalism, but I can't help but think
that the focus on finitude is a capitalist economic argument: if
supply (of time) is unlimited, then price (value) goes to zero. (I
don't believe this.)</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>It is by consciously confronting the certainty of death, and what
follows from the certainty of death, that we finally become truly
present for our lives. (page 63)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, no, no. This might be one path of reasoning that helps a person
become more present, but it isn't the only or necessary path.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>The real measure of any time management technique is <em>whether or not
it helps you neglect the right things.</em> (page 72)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>There's a section with these three principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay yourself first</li>
<li>Limit your work in progress<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.personalkanban.com/">Personal Kanban</a> suggests
    limiting to three things.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Resist the allure of middling priorities</li>
</ul>
<p>This all seems like basically good advice.</p>
<hr>
<p>So this Bergson guy wrote <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_and_Free_Will">Time and free will</a> (mentioned on page
83) and, I mean, cool title, but otherwise doesn't seem that good,
especially if the thinking is similar in quality to Bergson's ideas
about motivated evolution.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Machine for misusing your life (page 94)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Burkeman mostly tries to avoid the appearance of value judgments by
framing the objective as spending time on what you value (whatever
that is) but he does come out clearly against social media. So you
better not value social media!</p>
<hr>
<p>There's an interesting sort of story about a monk's experience with
ice water, the point of which was that trying to ignore or deny the
experience of cold was worse than focusing on the experience and
accepting, living the experience.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>You're obliged to deal with how your experience is unfolding in this
moment, to resign yourself to the reality that <em>this is it.</em> (page
106)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He's trying to connect boredom to finitude in the sense of limited
lifespan, but he accidentally gives the lie to it. It isn't that
you're upset that you're using your limited time on Earth in a way
that isn't fun; it's that it isn't fun "in this moment."</p>
<p>He does talk about living in the moment, but doesn't seem to resolve
the conflict with the lifespan view.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>The real problem isn’t planning. It’s that we take our plans to be
something they aren’t. What we forget, or can’t bear to confront, is
that, in the words of the American meditation teacher Joseph
Goldstein, ‘a plan is just a thought’. We treat our plans as though
they are a lasso, thrown from the present around the future, in
order to bring it under our command. But all a plan is – all it
could ever possibly be – is a present-moment statement of intent.
It’s an expression of your current thoughts about how you’d ideally
like to deploy your modest influence over the future. The future, of
course, is under no obligation to comply. (page 123)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This makes sense. What's the quote I think of... Eisenhower: "Plans
are worthless, but planning is everything." The plan has no influence
over the future, but it does help you make decisions in the moments
you encounter.</p>
<hr>
<p>Burkeman mentions
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1456312030">Radically Condensed Instructions for Being Just as You Are</a>, which
is more nondualist, the-moment-is-all-there-is stuff.</p>
<p><em>Trying</em> to live in the moment is like trying too hard to sleep.
Trying to force it pushes you further from it. But on the other hand,
you have no other option but to be here now.</p>
<hr>
<p>Burkeman mentions Lafargue's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Right_to_Be_Lazy">The right to be lazy</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"According to Lafargue, wage labour is tantamount to slavery, and to
fight as a labour movement for the extension of slavery is
preposterous. In the book, Lafargue proposes the right to be lazy,
in contrast to the right to work, which he deems bourgeois."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="/20240921-fully_automated_luxury_communism_by_bastani/">Fully Automated Luxury Communism</a>!</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>‘Nothing is more alien to the present age than idleness,’ writes the
philosopher John Gray. He adds: ‘How can there be play in a time
when nothing has meaning unless it leads to something else?’ (page
154)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think Burkeman also talks about instrumental use of time and tourist
photography, the "stop taking pictures and experience it" argument.</p>
<p>I think of my "<a href="/20181204-worth_doing_even_if_it_fails/">Is it worth doing even if it fails?</a>" which I think
is somewhat related... value the act itself regardless of the outcome.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>The publisher and editor Karen Rinaldi feels about surfing the same
way that I do about cheesy piano rock, only more so: she dedicates
every spare moment she can to it, and even wiped out her savings on
a plot of land in Costa Rica for better access to the sea. Yet she
readily admits that she remains an appalling surfer to this day. (It
took her five years of attempting to catch a wave before she first
managed to do so.) But ‘in the process of trying to attain a few
moments of bliss’, Rinaldi explains, ‘I experience something else:
patience and humility, definitely, but also freedom. Freedom to
pursue the futile. And the freedom to suck without caring is
revelatory.’ Results aren’t everything. Indeed, they’d better not
be, because results always come later – and later is always too
late. (page 160)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Burkeman talks about a painting called "Boy with a Squirrel," but that
painting is "A Boy with a Flying Squirrel." <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Boy_with_a_Flying_Squirrel">Flying</a>!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It depicts Copley's teenaged half-brother Henry Pelham with a pet
flying squirrel, a creature commonly found in colonial American
portraits as a symbol of the sitter's refinement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How cool is that!</p>
<hr>
<p>There are "Three principles of patience" (around page 180)</p>
<ul>
<li>Develop a taste for having problems<ul>
<li>This reminds me of my first "thinking card,"
   <a href="https://planspace.org/20201206-thinking_cards/#1">embrace problems</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Embrace radical incrementalism </li>
<li>Originality lies on the far side of unoriginality</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Burkeman has this idea, "cosmic insignificance therapy," which is
intended to be a relief. It reminds me of the
<a href="https://hitchhikers.fandom.com/wiki/Total_Perspective_Vortex">total perspective vortex</a> from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the
Galaxy, but of course there it was supposed to be a method of torture.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a sort of cruelty, Iddo Landau points out, in holding
yourself to standards nobody could ever reach (and which many of us
would never dream of demanding of other people). The more humane
approach is to drop such efforts as completely as you can. Let your
impossible standards crash to the ground. Then pick a few meaningful
tasks from the rubble and get started on them today. (page 222)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Burkeman mentions this documentary, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13675784/">A Life’s Work</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What's it like to dedicate your life to work that won't be completed
in your lifetime? Fifteen years ago, filmmaker David Licata focused
on four projects and the people behind them in an effort to answer
this universal question.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To me this is about caring about something, whether it makes sense or
not, making meaning for yourself, and not really at all about death.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>You could think of this book as an extended argument for the
empowering potential of giving up hope. (page 231)</p>

<title>Make everything into Roth IRA</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>Retirement accounts are surprisingly flexible. Rules meant to keep
high earners from making certain contributions and to discourage
withdrawals before age 59½ can largely be worked around. Everything
can and often should get put into a Roth IRA.</p>
<p><img alt="table" src="table.png"></p>

<p>All these accounts are about avoiding taxes, to encourage you to save
for retirement. “Traditional” accounts can be funded with “pre-tax
dollars,” and then you pay taxes when you move money out. Money you
put into “Roth” accounts has already been taxed, so when you take it
out it's “tax free.”</p>
<p>Traditional accounts can <em>also</em> be funded with after-tax dollars. If
your 401k plan allows it, you can contribute after-tax dollars beyond
the usual limit. This might seem pointless, except that you can then
<em>convert</em> those contributions to Roth. This allows you to put quite a
lot of money into a Roth 401k, and is sometimes called “mega backdoor
Roth 401k.” <em>(orange arrow in diagram)</em></p>
<p>People with <a href="https://www.schwab.com/ira/roth-ira/contribution-limits">high incomes</a> aren't allowed to contribute directly to
Roth IRAs (Individual Retirement Accounts) and (with slightly
different <a href="https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/ira-deduction-limits">limitations</a>) can't deduct contributions to a Traditional
IRA. But anyone can contribute after-tax dollars to a Traditional IRA
and then convert those contributions to Roth. This is sometimes called
“backdoor Roth IRA.” <em>(part of purple arrow in diagram)</em></p>
<p>After you've left an employer, you can convert your 401k accounts to
corresponding IRAs without tax implications. Mega backdoor Roth 401k
may be convertible to Roth IRA even while still employed. <em>(green
arrows in diagram)</em></p>
<p>You can also convert a Traditional 401k or Traditional IRA to a Roth
IRA. You pay tax on the converted amount. <em>(blue arrow, part of purple
arrow in diagram)</em> You can control the amounts of the conversions so
that you smooth your taxable income across years rather than having
large single conversion events that spike your annual income—and tax
rate.</p>
<p>Roth IRAs are particularly nice because they let you withdraw
contributions any time without penalty, which makes sense since they
were already taxed. In the case of roll-overs (conversions) you have
to wait five years before withdrawing penalty-free, but that can still
be years before age 59½, meaning money is not locked away to nearly
the same extent. Only investment gains are subject to penalty for
withdrawal before 59½. Additionally, Roth accounts are not subject to
Required Minimum Distributions starting around age 73 the way that
Traditional accounts are.</p>
<p>There are other exceptions to waiting until age 59½ (like if you leave
your job at 55 or older, or if you set up Substantially Equal Periodic
Payments under 72t) but you hardly need them.</p>
<h3>Example: $77k tax-advantaged in 2025</h3>
<p>The common employer-sponsored 401k has a $23,500 limit on total
pre-tax (“Traditional”) and Roth (after tax) employee contributions,
with a $70,000 total cap on employee and employer contributions.
Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) are limited to $7,000 in
contributions per year. (“Catch-up” adjustments increase these numbers
somewhat for people 50 and up.)</p>
<p>The choice of Traditional or Roth depends on your tax rate now
compared to when you expect to use the money, and there are
<a href="https://www.citizensbank.com/investing-and-wealth-management/products-services-and-calculators/financial-calculators/roth-401k-vs-traditional-401k-calculator.aspx">calculators</a> that can help you compare. If you are in a high tax
bracket currently, putting pre-tax money in a Traditional account can
help spread your income across years and lower the total effective tax
rate you pay.</p>
<p>Imagine a high-income individual under 50 who contributes $23,500
pre-tax to their 401k, reducing their tax for the current year. Say
they get 50% of that contribution matched by their employer ($11,750)
so the total pre-tax 401k contribution for the year is $35,250. After
they leave their employer, they can choose to convert that Traditional
401k to Roth IRA, paying tax when they make the conversion, and the
converted amount is withdrawable without penalty after five years.</p>
<p>Since the annual limit is $70,000, they can still contribute $34,750
more in after-tax dollars and convert that to Roth 401k. This can be
converted to Roth IRA at any point and the converted amount is
withdrawable without penalty after five years.</p>
<p>They can also contribute $7,000 (in after-tax dollars) toward a
Traditional IRA and then convert that to Roth, and the converted
amount is withdrawable without penalty after five years.</p>
<p>So in one year, this person has gotten $77,000 into tax-advantaged
retirement accounts, and the majority of it can be withdrawn without
penalty after just five years, regardless of their age.</p>

<title>Consider tax on investments</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>Taxes make everything more complicated. They vary based on your income
level, where you live, what investments you have, and what accounts
you have them in, and more. And they affect your real returns. Let's
compare income-generating investments.</p>
<form id="taxForm">

<h3>A nominally <input type="number" step="any" id="nominal_rate" value="5.00">% investment yields, after tax:</h3>

<ul>
  <li><b><span class="bignum" id="interest">3.50%</span></b> if it's regular interest from a bank, a CD, non-qualified dividends...
    <ul><li>Federal and state income tax apply.</li></ul>
  </li>
  <li><b><span class="bignum" id="dividend">3.75%</span></b> if it's <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/qualifieddividend.asp">qualified dividends</a>
    <ul><li>Federal long-term capital gains and state tax apply.</li></ul>
  </li>
  <li><b><span class="bignum" id="bond">4.00%</span></b> if it's interest from a US government bond
    <ul><li>Federal income tax applies, but not state tax.</li></ul>
  </li>
  <li><b><span class="bignum" id="muni">4.50%</span></b> if it's interest from a municipal bond
    <ul><li>Just state tax. (Or not; depends on your state and <a href="https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/not-always-tax-free-7-municipal-bond-tax-traps">other factors</a>.)</li></ul>
  </li>
</ul>


<!--
<p>

<p>Most states don't differentiate between regular income and capital
gains, so there's just the one state tax box here. It probably makes
sense to use your overall effective (“blended”) tax rates here, though
you could use your marginal rates if you want. And of course this all
assumes we're in the US.</p>

<title>What is real? by Becker</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<blockquote>
<p>“The fact that an adequate philsophical presentation
[of quantum physics] has been so long delayed is no doubt caused by
the fact that Niels Bohr brainwashed a whole generation of
theorists,” Gell-Mann wrote in 1976. (page 253)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a former physics undergraduate student, I was excited to see if the
ugly Copenhagen interpretation had finally been retired. Becker gave
me some hope but in the end it looks like people are still mostly
shutting up and calculating. I still like the “what is real” framing,
even if the <a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/adam-becker/what-is-real/9781541698970/">book</a> can't completely deliver.</p>
<p>A few thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>One of the unique things about quantum physics is its ontic
   randomness. Even just skimming some of the book's references, like
   <a href="https://ia601501.us.archive.org/1/items/in.ernet.dli.2015.204850/2015.204850.Natural-Philosophy_text.pdf">Born</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190601184313/https://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~hrp/issues/1999/Hermann.pdf">Hermann</a>, it's clear people were wrestling with
   this a lot. But the author sort of puts it out of scope.</li>
<li>How, in a book on what is real, do you come so close as to discuss
   Quine's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Dogmas_of_Empiricism">Two Dogmas</a> but not dive into the myth of physical
   objects? (To be clear, there is discussion of scientific realism,
   but this aspect of it isn't much explored, as I recall.)</li>
<li>Similarly, there isn't much discussion of what we really think
   exists. Pointlike particles? (In what sense does anybody believe in
   them?) Discrete space? Something else? In what may be a bit of
   humor, the very last note at the end of the book is about how many
   interpretations don't, in fact, believe in "particles" as such at
   all.</li>
<li>I would have liked for there to be more on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map%E2%80%93territory_relation">map vs. territory</a> as
   it pertains to what is real. Where do we think the theory is "real"
   vs. where is it just a model? (There is some discussion of
   epistemic vs. ontic interpretations, though this could have been
   clearer too. I think this connects to
   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unreasonable_Effectiveness_of_Mathematics_in_the_Natural_Sciences">Unreasonable Effectiveness</a>, which also would have been
   interesting to see explored more.</li>
<li>Another connection that seems interesting is the mathematical idea
   of model theory, where you differentiate between a formal system
   and a model that satisfies it. With multiple interpretations that
   don't seem to have different predictions than "standard quantum
   physics" the interpretations start to feel like models in this
   sense.</li>
<li>It would have been nice to get more/clearer on Heisenberg's
   uncertainty principle. Looking into it more myself, I got as far as
   an interesting hint that you can understand it as position and
   momentum wave functions being mutually Fourier transforms, so if
   one is narrow the other is spread out.</li>
<li>In general, the author seemed sometimes to assume knowledge instead
   of clearly laying out enough to get up to speed. Part of this is
   probably just trying to avoid technicality that would put people
   off. To illustrate: DeWitt's <a href="https://cqi.inf.usi.ch/qic/deWitt1970.pdf">Quantum Mechanics and Reality</a> is
   great (and very approximately a short version of the whole book)
   but it has enough math notation in it that it probably puts off a
   lot of people who would otherwise read and enjoy it. (And it's
   trying to be gentle itself.) But if you don't explain spin or
   polarization (etc.) at all, people will also be left out. And when
   interpretation is largely about putting meaning to the math, it's
   hard to think about if you never see the math.</li>
<li>What kinds of things are eligible to constitute an interpretation?
   The math alone seems not to be. Do things have to reduce to
   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Na%C3%AFve_physics">naïve physics</a> in order to be part of an interpretation? Is any
   (non-mathematical) abstraction acceptable? Must it satisfy some
   assumptions? (Some might have put locality in that bucket,
   previously?)</li>
</ul>
<p>What is the Copenhagen interpretation?</p>
<ul>
<li>divide quantum vs. classical scales (vague)</li>
<li>wave function collapse on observation (measurement problem)</li>
<li>no hidden variables (it's not just that we don't know the state
   yet)</li>
<li>says nothing about the world (?)</li>
<li>wave-particle duality ("complementarity")</li>
</ul>
<p>Other interpretations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bohm pilot-wave</li>
<li>multiple worlds</li>
<li>superdeterminism</li>
<li>spontaneous collapse</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end, I still don't understand all of physics. Magnets are
weird. Light is weird. Gravity is weird. Becker has more to say
tearing down Copenhagen than in building any particular replacement;
as in the subtitle, the quest is unfinished. Excelsior?</p>

<p>“The soundest fact may fail or prevail in the style of its telling.”
(Ursula K. Le Guin)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is from <em>The Left Hand of Darkness.</em></p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>The godfather of quantum physics, Niels Bohr, talked about a
division between the world of big objects, where classical Newtonian
physics ruled, and small objects, where quantum physics reigned. But
Bohr was maddeningly unclear about the location of the boundary
between the world. (page 9)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This alone is not such a big deal. Different models apply to different
views, scales, etc. Statistical Mechanics doesn't apply to individual
particles, for example. It is weird if you treat the divide as
fundamental, but if you treat it as a matter of convenience or
approximation, I don't have a problem with it.</p>
<p>The heart of the Copenhagen weirdness is the measurement problem as in
Schrödinger's cat: denying decided existence until we look.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Born's book, <a href="https://ia601501.us.archive.org/1/items/in.ernet.dli.2015.204850/2015.204850.Natural-Philosophy_text.pdf"><em>Natural Philosophy of Cause and Chance</em></a>, made
quite an impression on Bell—especially the discussion of a proof by
the great mathematician and physicist John von Neumann. According to
Born, von Neumann had proven that the Copenhagen interpretation was
the only possible way of understanding quantum physics. So either
the Copenhagen interpretation was correct or quantum physics was
wrong. And, given the wild success of quantum physics, it seemed
that Copenhagen and its vagueness were here to stay. (pages 9-10)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, what does Born say?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It would be silly and arrogant to deny any possibility of a return
to determinism. For no physical theory is final; new experiences may
force us to alterations and even reversions. Yet scanning the
history of physics in the way we have done we see fluctuations and
vacillations, but hardly a reversion to more primitive conceptions.
I expect that our present theory will be profoundly modified. For it
is full of difficulties which I have not mentioned at all—the
self-energies of particles in interaction and many other quantities,
like collision cross-sections, lead to divergent integrals. But I
should never expect that these difficulties could be solved by a
return to classical concepts. I expect just the opposite, that we
shall have to sacrifice some current ideas and use still more
abstract methods. However, these are only opinions. A more concrete
contribution to this question has been made by J. v. Neumann in his
brillant book, <em>Mathematische Grundlagen der Quantenmechanik.</em> He
puts the theory on an axiomatic basis by deriving it from a few
postulates of a very plausible and general character, about the
properties of 'expectation values’ (averages) and their
representation by mathematical symbols. The result is that the
formalism of quantum mechanics is uniquely determined by these
axioms; in particular, no concealed parameters can be introduced
with the help of which the indeterministic description could be
transformed into a deterministic one. Hence if a future theory
should be deterministic, it cannot be a modification of the present
one but must be essentially different. How this should be possible
without sacrificing a whole treasure of well-established results I
leave to the determinists to worry about. (<em>Natural Philosophy of
Cause and Chance</em> pages 108-109)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This isn't about the Copenhagen interpretation, is it? This is about
hidden variables? (No-hidden-variables isn't what we mean by
Copenhagen, is it? I thought everybody agreed about no hidden
variables...)</p>
<p>This is fairly bad for the big structure of the book, which hinges on
the "proof of the Copenhagen interpretation" coming undone.</p>
<p>Coming back to this later: Maybe no-hidden-variables is/was part of
the Copenhagen interpretation? It seems like the author argues the
pilot-wave interpretation has hidden variables (but not locality) and
that shows von Neumann was wrong. But still, Born was talking about
determinism, and hidden variables also isn't the same thing as
determinism...</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>What does quantum physics tell us about the world? According to the
Copenhagen interpretation, this question has a very simple answer:
quantum physics tells us nothing whatsoever about the world. (page
14)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is this quite fair? Doesn't it say the cat is both alive and dead?
It's a weird thing to say, but it seems to say it...</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Quantum physics uses infinite collections of numbers called <em>wave
functions</em> to describe the world. (page 16)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a little bit like calling a line an infinite collection of
numbers: technically true but not super helpful.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Once you do find that electron, a funny thing happens to its wave
function. Rather than following the Schrödinger equation like a good
wave function, it collapses—it instantly becomes zero everywhere
except in the place where you found the electron. (page 17)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is there a problem in treating the wave function as describing our
state of knowledge? We don't have any problem with making
probabilistic predictions, for example, and then when we get data we
switch from the probabilistic prediction to the observed data. How
different is the quantum wave function really?</p>
<p>(I think there <em>is</em> a problem in thinking about it this way, and it
would have been nice for the author to make this clearer... For
example, if the wave function is 50% along two paths, they shouldn't
interfere with one another if the wave function is just a description
of our knowledge.)</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>So what is real? Copenhagen's reply is silence—and a look of stern
disapproval for having the temerity to ask the question in the first
place. (page 20)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At some point we really can't say anything about the "underlying
reality" of what we observe. Is quantum mechanics that boundary?</p>
<p>(No.)</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Mach">Mach</a> believed that science should be based on descriptive laws
that don't make any claims about the true nature of the world—he
dismissed such claims as unnecessary for the practice of science. To
Mach, one of the worst offenders was the great god of physics, Isaac
Newton himself. Newton's master-work, the <em>Principia,</em> opened with
the assumption that space and time were absolute entities unto
themselves, with real existence out in the world. This “conceptual
monstrosity of absolute space” was, in Mach's view, “purely a
thought-thing which cannot be pointed to in experience.” Mach
thought that a proper science of mechanics would dispense with these
kinds of ontological claims—claims about what things actually exist
in the real world—and instead simply lay down descriptive,
mathematical laws that accurately predict the observed motion of all
objects. Good theories, according to Mach, were about connecting
observations, not about positing things that couldn't be observed at
all. (page 25)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Map and territory... How different is it to have absolute space be
model, just "act as if," without the ontological claim?</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Mach had loudly and repeatedly proclaimed that he did not believe in
atoms, as they were too small to be observable in principle. (page
27)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is silly. Nothing is <em>directly</em> observable in principle, and yet
we believe in chairs, other people, etc.</p>
<p>If he's <em>really</em> positivist, how does he believe in anything other
than claims about sense perceptions? "I see a chair" doesn't imply "I
believe there is a chair."</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Heisenberg started thinking about what would happen if you tried to
measure the position of a single particle, like an electron, to very
high precision. He realized that you could do this the same way
you'd look for a lost wallet in a dark field: shine a flashlight
around until you've found what you're looking for. An ordinary
flashlight wouldn't work for an electron, though—the wavelength of
visible light is far too large for that. But Heisenberg knew you
could find an electron using higher-energy light, with a shorter
wavelength: gamma rays. Shine a gamma-ray flashlight around a room,
and you'll find your electron. But gamma rays pack a punch—bounce
one gamma-ray photon off an electron, and the electron will go
careening off in some random direction. So you'll know where the
electron was, but you won't know how fast it's going or where it's
heading now. (page 38)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a standard bad take. Even if there's some historicity to it,
in how Heisenberg was thinking, it's misleading to make uncertainty
seem like it's about physicality of measurement.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Bohr pointed to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle as further
justification for the inevitability of complementarity. Using
Heisenberg's gamma-ray flashlight as an example, he pointed out that
there was no way to precisely measure the momentum of an electron
when observing its position, and vice versa. Bohr then echoed Mach,
as Heisenberg had, and claimed the impossibility of measuring both
properties simultaneously. Position and momentum, like particles and
waves, were complementary—never used at once but both needed for the
complete description of a situation.</p>
<p>But Bohr was wrong. There was nothing inevitable or necessary about
complementarity—other interpretations of quantum physics are
possible. Indeed, the claim of inevitability is an awfully strong
and strange claim to make about any interpretive issue in science,
precisely because it is always possible to reinterpret any theory.
Yet Bohr was convinced that complementarity was the deepest insight
into nature found within the quantum theory.</p>
<p>Stranger still is Bohr's use of the gamma-ray flashlight to bolster
his claims. It's certainly true that the thought experiment
illustrates a world in which there are limits on our knowledge, but
it's also a world where particles have well-defined positions and
momenta at all times. Hitting an electron with a gamma ray can't
alter the electron's momentum unless it has a momentum in the first
place. We don't know what that momentum is—but that's certainly not
the same thing as saying it doesn't exist. (page 40)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Why were Bohr, Heisenberg, and others so convinced that the quantum
world couldn't be visualized? Why did they seem to think that things
couldn't be real until they were observed? Why did they insist that
the classical world obeyed fundamentally different rules from the
quantum world? Why, in short, did they believe the strange
assemblage of claims that came to be known as the Copenhagen
interpretation? (page 47)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>He dismissively said of another physicist's paper that “it is not

the quantum world simply falls away. Objects have definite positions
at all times, whether or not anyone is looking at them. Particles
have a wave nature, but there's nothing “complementary” about
it—particles are just particles, and their motions are guided by
pilot waves. Particles surf along these waves, guided by the waves'
motion (hence the name). Heisenberg's uncertainty principle still
holds—the more we know about a particle's position, the less we know
about its momentum, and vice versa—but according to Bohm, this is
simply a limitation on the information that the quantum world is
willing to yield to us. (page 98)</p>

<p>Quine spends more time on the analytic-synthetic distinction than on
reductionism ("the verification theory of meaning").</p>
<p>On the analytic-synthetic distinction, I think Quine is pointing out
problems with human language, not proving the non-distinction he aims
to prove. Certainly mathematical tautologies are analytic.</p>
<p>It is indeed hard to talk about the world though (synthetic). From the wiki:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to Quine, there are two different results of his
reasoning. The first is a blurring of the line between metaphysics
and natural science. The common-sense theory about physical objects
is epistemologically comparable to the gods of Homer. Quine is a
physicalist, in the sense that he considers it a scientific error
not to adopt a theory which makes reference to physical objects.
However, like Gods of Homer, physical objects are posits, and there
is no great epistemic difference in kind; the difference is rather
that the theory of physical objects has turned out to be a more
efficient theory. After having defined himself an "empiricist",
Quine states in Two Dogmas: "The myth of physical objects is
epistemologically superior to most in that it has proved more
efficacious than other myths as a device for working a manageable
structure into the flux of experience".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I like this "myth of physical objects;" maybe that's a helpful phrase
for thinking about things. As in the discussion of books and electrons
above: which myths do you think are useful? Which do you really
believe? Is it helpful to "really believe" in those things in Plato's
realm of ideals?</p>

<p>First, "bears no relation at all to the actual stuff in the world" is
not the same as "is the same as the actual stuff in the world."
Electrons can be a useful thing to act as if is real, regardless of
whether electrons "exist" in a physical sense or we're in a simulation
that's programmed as if there are electrons.</p>

<p>The theories themselves suggest explanations for the phenomena that
we see based on the unobserved stuff. But if the unobserved stuff is
just a convenient picture that just happens to come along with the
“real” content of the theory (i.e., the predictions about the
observable world) and that picture really doesn't line up with the
stuff in the world in any way, then we're astonishingly lucky that
our theories work so well! (page 185)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why do we even need a different [from Copenhagen] interpretation,
much less a different theory altogether
[given quantum theory works so well]?</p>
<p>Bell framed his reply as a moral issue. “It is not right to tell the
public that a central role for conscious mind is integrated into
modern atomic physics. Or that ‘information’ is the real stuff of
physical theory. It seems to me irresponsible to suggest that
technical features of contemporary theory were anticipated by the
saints of ancient religions ... by introspection.” Bell felt an
urgent need to solve the problems at the core of quantum physics—but
he had little patience for purported solutions that were little more
than vague declarations of faith. He wanted something more definite,
something that wasn't a professional embarrassment, a true theory
that didn't shy away from questions about what happened during
measurement. His relentlessly clear writing gave no quarter to
anyone hoping to take solace in the comforting platitudes of the
Copenhagen interpretation. “Surely, after 62 years, we should have
an exact formulation of some part of quantum mechanics?” Bell said
in 1989. “[Measurement devices] should not be separated off from the
rest of the world into black boxes, as if [they] were not made of
atoms and not ruled by quantum mechanics.” In a talk he gave in
Geneva in January 1990, Bell acknowledged that the task at hand was
difficult and that his own theorem proved that there was some
radical change necessary, something that physics would have to come
to terms with. “I think you're stuck with the nonlocality,” Bell
told the small group who came to hear him speak that day. “I don't
know any conception of locality which works with quantum mechanics.”</p>

decoherence means, and why the splitting of many worlds doesn't
necessarily have the observer problem any more.</p>

<p>Finally, the EWG ["many worlds"] interpretation of quantum mechanics
has an important contribution to make to the philosophy of science.
By showing that formalism alone is sufficient to generate
interpretation, it has breathed new life into the old idea of a
direct correspondence between formalism and reality. The reality
implied here is admittedly bizarre. To anyone who is awestruck by
the vastness of the presently known universe, the view from where
Everett, Wheeler and Graham sit is truly impressive. Yet it is a
completely causal view, which even Einstein might have accepted. At
any rate, it has a better claim than most to be the natural end
product of the interpretation program begun by Heisenberg in 1925.</p>

<p>Something interesting happens then, doesn't it? Quantum mechanics is
indeed ontologically random, at the lowest level, and the wave
function captures that. But as we look backward in time, it's
epistemic from the point of view of the evolution of our specific
world vantage point. Before we start a Schrödinger's cat experiment,
we predict 50/50 odds and that's really true, there's an irreducible
randomness. After running the experiment, however, the wave function
describes our state of knowledge but not the reality. The cat really
is alive or dead and not both, in the world path that we're really in.</p>
<p>And that's how it always is, isn't it? Predictions forward, knowledge
backward...</p>

<title>(Audio) I Hate the Ivy League, by Gladwell</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>This is the first time I've seen a collection of podcasts packaged as
an <a href="https://www.pushkin.fm/audiobooks/i-hate-the-ivy-league-riffs-and-rants-on-elite-education">audiobook</a>. There is no corresponding printed book that you can
buy. Sort of weird, but Gladwell is good enough that it works.</p>
<hr>
<p>I tend to agree with Gladwell. Education shouldn't be an elitist thing
based on keeping people out.</p>
<hr>
<p>One thing Gladwell discusses is two opposing views of what education
should do, corresponding to two opposing views of what we need.</p>
<p>He uses basketball and soccer to illustrate the two views, saying that
in basketball you win based on your <em>best</em> players, while in soccer
you win based on your <em>worst</em> players. So in basketball it's okay to
have some weaker players, if your star/s is/are great, while in soccer
you might win more by improving your worst players.</p>
<p>I've heard this explicitly, for education. Kai-fu Lee <a href="/20200926-ai_superpowers_by_lee/" title="AI Superpowers, by Lee">says</a> that
good educational "programs seek to identify and realize the potential
of the country's top technical minds, an approach suited to creating
the material prosperity that can then be broadly shared across
society."</p>
<p>From another angle, it's the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_man_theory">great man theory</a> against the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ortega_hypothesis">Ortega hypothesis</a>, roughly.</p>
<p>From another angle, it's conservatism vs. progressivism: individuals
should be able to succeed wildly, vs. the poorest should be helped.</p>
<p>Gladwell also relates this idea to the Industrial Revolution happening
in England. He attributes it to the abundance of tinkerers/inventors
all working on things. (Cf. <a href="/20250322-power_and_progress_by_acemoglu_and_johnson/">Power and Progress</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p>Gladwell doesn't like timed tests. I'm a little torn, but I do have to
wonder: Did timed standardized tests influence my work style? Would I
have been better off with more focus on longer-term planning and
projects?</p>

<p>“Mirror-tocracy”</p>

<p>There's an interesting bit about how <a href="https://mcconville.rbind.io/">Kelly McConville</a>'s students
reverse-engineered the US News college rankings. It's a place where
regression makes sense, because the methodology of the rankings
matches up with what regression can do. It also reminded me of my old
project on <a href="/20190529-understanding_myintuition/">Understanding MyinTuition</a>.</p>

<title>(Audio) Power and Progress, by Acemoglu and Johnson</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>This <a href="https://shapingwork.mit.edu/power-and-progress/">book</a> from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daron_Acemoglu" title="Daron Acemoglu">Acemoglu</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Johnson_(economist)" title="Simon Johnson (economist)">Johnson</a> explains that
technological progress doesn't automatically make everyone better off.
They're right, but they're also too conventional to see beyond the
labor exchange paradigm, constraining the application of their thesis.</p>
<p>The authors understand that we make choices about who benefits from
technology, but they're also committed to the idea that people should
have to work for a living. This limits their imagination and results
in recommendations that pursue full employment instead of enabling a
vision of a yet brighter future.</p>
<p><img alt="cover" src="cover.jpg"></p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Workers complained about conditions and the backbreaking effort.
Most egregious to many were the rules they had to follow in
factories. One weaver put it this way in 1834: “No man would like to
work in a power-loom, they do not like it, there is such a
clattering and noise it would almost make some men mad; and next, he
would have to be subject to a discipline that a hand-loom weaver can
never submit to.”</p>
<p>New machinery turned workers into mere cogs. As another weaver
testified before a parliamentary committee in April 1835, “I am
determined for my part, that if they will invent machines to
supersede manual labour, they must find iron boys to mind them.”
(page 8)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I include this selection because I found the phrase “iron boys”
weirdly evocative in its contrast. It reminds me a little bit of
“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Windup_Girl" title="The Windup Girl">windup girls</a>.”</p>
<p>The point of the weaver is that working with the new machines is less
pleasant than his accustomed artisanal process. It is less humane. It
is dehumanizing.</p>
<p>It also highlights that the conversion is incomplete; the attempt “to
supersede manual labor” has not fully succeeded, while people still
have to work with the machines. I find myself agreeing that “they must
find iron boys to mind them.”</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>“In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novum_Organum"><em>Novum Organum</em></a>, published in 1620, Bacon had argued that
scientific knowledge would enable nothing less than human control
over nature.” (page 12)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I feel like I should have recognized this immediately, but I had to
look it up. It is the shift from pure logic to focus on observation.
Pure logic is limited or full of madness; science has shaky
foundations but remarkable technological fruit.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Optimism regarding shared benefits from technological progress is
founded on a simple and powerful idea: the “productivity bandwagon.”
This idea maintains that new machines and production methods that
increase productivity will also produce higher wages. As technology
progresses, the bandwagon will pull along everybody, not just
entrepreneurs and owners of capital. (page 15)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the one hand, it seems ridiculous that anyone would believe in such
a “productivity bandwagon,” but on the other hand, people do seem to
believe something like it, often.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>technology is about control, not just over nature but often over
other humans. It is not simply that technological change benefits
some more than others. More fundamentally, different ways of
organizing production enrich and empower some people and disempower
others. (page 26)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This could be a thesis for the book.</p>
<p>There is perhaps a false divide between “nature” and “other humans.”
In both cases there is an “othering.”</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Central to this volte-face was a change in the direction of
technology away from new tasks and opportunities for workers and
toward a preoccupation with automating work and cutting labor costs.
(page 32)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Listening to the audiobook and unfamiliar with “volte-face,” which is
French for “about-face” (a complete and sudden change) I made a quick
mental note to look it up later. Only half-remembering the context, I
thought it might be some proper noun I was unfamiliar with. I guessed
it was spelled “voltfass” and that it might be German. Asking ChatGPT
about this, it was happy to hallucinate and send me on a merry chase
around the internet. It took me quite some time to track it to what it
actually was.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>To understand <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_de_Lesseps" title="Ferdinand de Lesseps">Lesseps</a>’s vision, we must first turn to the ideas
of the French social reformer Henri de Saint-Simon and his colorful
followers. Saint-Simon was an aristocratic writer who maintained
that human progress is driven by scientific invention and the
application of new ideas to industry. But he also thought that the
right leadership was critical for this progress: “All enlightened
peoples will adopt the view that men of genius should be given the
highest social standing.” (page 36)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay so <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_de_Lesseps" title="Ferdinand de Lesseps">Lesseps</a> was this canal guy who made the Suez Canal and
then failed to make the Panama Canal because he stubbornly wanted to
do it the same way. The chapter is called “Canal Vision” and it's
basically saying look, the best ideas don't win automatically.
Personality matters, reputation matters, rhetoric matters. And if you
put all your faith in this one guy, he can screw it up.</p>
<p>This all hits fairly close to home. At work, I sometimes feel like I'm
witnessing a Panama Canal effect, where someone who had past success
is forging ahead with something new regardless of whether the new
thing is a good idea really. “Vision is power,” influence without
authority, etc.</p>
<hr>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daron_Acemoglu" title="Daron Acemoglu">Acemoglu</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Johnson_(economist)" title="Simon Johnson (economist)">Johnson</a> are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_institutional_economics">New Institutional Economics</a>
guys, and they talk about how they think the Industrial Revolution
happened in Britain because people could try to get rich and were
allowed to.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Friedman, who, like Hayek and Stigler, was awarded the Nobel Prize
in economics, made important contributions to many areas, including
macroeconomics, price theory, and monetary policy. Arguably,
however, his most influential work did not appear in an academic
journal but in a short piece published in September 1970 in the New
York Times Magazine, immodestly titled “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1970/09/13/archives/a-friedman-doctrine-the-social-responsibility-of-business-is-to.html" title="A Friedman doctrine‐- The Social Responsibility of Business Is to Increase Its Profits">A Friedman Doctrine</a>.”
Friedman argued that the “social responsibility” of business was
misconstrued. Business should care only about making profits and
generating high returns for their shareholders. Simply put, “The
social responsibility of business is to increase its profits.” (page
205)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh my. I think I hadn't realized that this had been put so explicitly.</p>
<hr>
<p>They go on about “Machine Usefulness” and automation vs. creating new
tasks, and there's something to it, but I don't think it amounts to an
optimal path forward. They're focused on ensuring that benefits go to
workers, but I think we need to get beyond making everybody be a
worker.</p>

<title>(Audio) Superconvergence, by Metzl</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Metzl">Metzl</a> rubs me the wrong way, a little bit, the way the heros of
LinkedIn do. He's been bio-focused, and still is, but AI is hot so AI
is in the book. He's not wrong, exactly, but it still feels
attention-seeking. <a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/jamie-metzl/superconvergence/9781643263007/">The book</a> has very low information density, and
then weirdly his main objective in the end is to get people excited
about regulation.</p>
<p>Metzl advocates for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ortega_hypothesis">Ortega hypothesis</a>, but mostly because it
fits well with his story of exponential scientific progress: if we
don't have to wait for geniuses, then progress can keep accelerating.
Interesting take.</p>
<p>He talks a lot about god-like powers, and how we need to regulate
them. He's at pains to say this shouldn't be a global body imposing
rules, but that every country should do things in line with their own
culture and values. Ignoring that requiring countries to regulate
where they wouldn't on their own is already an imposition, this
federated approach only works if we have fairly strong assumptions
about every government's culture and values playing well with what we
think is reasonable. But then he goes on to say that also there should
be international coordination, seemingly with more teeth than the WHO
and so on, so he is arguing for global control in the end as well.</p>
<p>Metzl also believes <a href="https://jamiemetzl.com/origins-of-sars-cov-2/">fairly strongly</a> that COVID-19 was produced by
humans. It makes sense to talk about this in the book because it adds
weight to the discussion of risks, making it not just hypothetical.
This kind of talk always makes me think of the assassination germ idea
in <a href="/20200124-three_body_problem_remembrance_of_earths_past/">The Three Body Problem</a>. Scary stuff indeed.</p>

<title>(Audio) Playing with Reality, by Clancy</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>I think <a href="https://www.npr.org/people/724387257/darian-woods">Darian Woods</a> mentioned <a href="https://www.kellybclancy.com/">Clancy</a>'s book in an episode of
The Indicator. Great recommendation! <em>Playing with Reality</em> could be
the best book of the year. Beautifully written, rich with information,
humane in perspective. The thesis is basically that the map is not the
territory, and games can be kinds of maps. Sort of like
<a href="/20200425-tyranny_of_metrics_by_muller/">The Tyranny of Metrics</a>, it explores ways that simplified and
quantified models can mislead. Fascinating throughout.</p>
<p><img alt="cover" src="cover.jpg"></p>
<hr>
<h3>History of education</h3>
<p>The first game in the book is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rithmomachia">Rithmomachia</a>, the math game you
played as part of your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrivium">Quadrivium</a> education, which was a thing
from Greek to Medieval times. The history of education is fascinating.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivium">Trivium</a><ul>
<li>grammar</li>
<li>logic</li>
<li>rhetoric</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrivium">Quadrivium</a><ul>
<li>“arithmetic (pure numbers)”</li>
<li>“geometry (numbers in space)”</li>
<li>“music (numbers in time)”</li>
<li>“astronomy (numbers in space and time)” (page 5)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“Some medieval historians blame the quadrivial curriculum for
holding European scholarship back hundreds of years. Its focus on
harmony blinkered scientists to fundamental advances, such as the
discovery of irrational numbers and celestial mechanics. The
quadrivial curriculum was largely abandoned by the seventeenth
century, as new mathematical techniques from Persia and India led to
breakthroughs in calculus and probability theory. Rithmomachia
similarly fell by the wayside.” (page 7)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This idea, of education hampering progress, is very interesting. I
wonder whether things like the Chinese exam system might have had a
similar effect. What about the current education system? What is
blocking rather than enabling progress?</p>
<p>The book doesn't talk about it, but according to Wikipedia an
intermediate successor curriculum was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitas#Revival">studia humanitatis</a>
around the 14th century, with Petrarch.</p>
<ul>

<li>rhetoric</li>
<li>poetry</li>
<li>history</li>
<li>moral philosophy</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Later, the book describes "required training for nobility in Europe
and the Near East."</p>
<ul>
<li>an eighteenth century aristocrat was expected to master<ul>
<li>calligraphy</li>
<li>horseback riding</li>
<li>history</li>
<li>philosophy</li>
<li>weaponry</li>
<li>music</li>
<li>astrology</li>
<li>games, especially chess</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“Kriegsspiel roots back to the late eighteenth century, when
mathematician Johann Hellwig invented a variant of chess. Chess was
then considered to be required training for nobility in Europe and
the Near East; an aristocrat was expected to master calligraphy,
horseback riding, history, philosophy, weaponry, music, astrology,
and games, especially chess. Tutors used chess to teach strategic
thinking and mathematics to their pupils. Chess, originally
chaturanga, originated in India as an explicit abstraction of war.”
(page 47)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lots of the book is about how we learn from games, but in explicitly
educational contexts and elsewhere.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Psychohistory</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“The new field’s [statistics'] success expanded to other social
sciences. The nineteenth-century Belgian mathematician Adolphe
Quetelet was a tireless advocate for a new science he called “social
physics,” whereby he hoped to work out a human correlate of
celestial mechanics and describe the trajectories of civilization.
Quetelet used massive datasets to detect underlying patterns. He
found regularities in births, deaths, suicides, and even crime
rates. He argued that crimes should not be considered acts of
individual volition. Instead, he found that they obeyed statistical
laws at the population level. “Society itself contains the germs of
all the crimes committed. It is the social state, in some measure,
that prepares these crimes, and the criminal is merely the
instrument that executes them.” Criminals were themselves victims,
helpless to the laws of social physics acting on society, a
necessary sacrifice to preserve civilization. He suggested that
evidence-based legislation—aimed more at ameliorating the
institutional causes of crime and less at punishing individual
criminals themselves—was the best hope for reforming society.
Quetelet’s ideas were so pervasive that physicist James Clerk
Maxwell often illustrated his work in statistical mechanics using
analogies drawn from social physics. To those armed with the hammer
of probability theory, the world looked like a statistics problem.
If we could use math to understand even chance, why not use it to
understand humanity itself?” (page 40)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Social physics” is yet another name for <a href="/20200714-foundation_trilogy/">psychohistory</a>!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The historian Hans Delbrück recognized that military and political
history are inextricably tangled. He was committed to establishing a
quantitative study of history. Throughout his career, Delbrück pored
over historical data, hoping to develop a science of war,
relentlessly workshopping historical battles to test his theories.
He argued that Germany’s failures in World War I were primarily
strategic in nature. He advocated for their neutered military to
take up historical study and simulations. By embracing these
simulations during the interwar period, the Germans developed a new
form of combat using theoretical forces that did not yet exist but
soon would. It promised to solve the stagnant trench warfare that
had characterized World War I, leveraging surprise to dominate and
demoralize the enemy. In World War II, this tactic would rain terror
from the skies across Europe. It would come to be known throughout
the world as the Blitzkrieg.” (page 52)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And again!</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>“The real question,” he [Skinner] writes, “is not whether machines
think but whether men do. The mystery which surrounds a thinking
machine already surrounds a thinking man.” (page 21)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think Skinner is getting at the questions of consciousness and free
will. Provocative phrasing.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>“Like many scientists of the era, such as Galileo, Cardano was made
a celebrity by the horoscopes he drew up for the ruling class.
Astrology played the role of today’s science-funding agencies.”
(page 34)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes data science work feels a little like this. People want
predictions, and they don't always want a careful accounting of
uncertainty. They want to hear what they want to hear. And like magic
or divination, why not just take a stab at it? You'll be right
sometimes!</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>“It seemed so ubiquitous that many scientists used it to simplify
the measurement of errors in a wide range of datasets, including
many they shouldn’t have. They were, as mathematician Nassim
Nicholas Taleb puts it, “blinded by bell curves.” (page 40)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This idea is applied to Black–Scholes, and Taleb's “ludic fallacy” is
described: the mistake of applying the rules of games to real-life
situations.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>“Through seemingly objective arguments like these, the status quo
keeps its finger tipping the scales in the marketplace of ideas,
assigning invented values to justify arbitrary ideologies.” (page
45)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The example is weird MacAskill argument. These "Effective Altruism"
people, jeez.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>“His [Hilbert's] student Hermann Weyl writes: “Mathematics is no
longer knowledge but a game of formulae, ruled by certain
conventions, which is very well comparable to the game of chess.”
(page 58)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>“We may still choose to make a wager with a low likelihood of
success if the outcome is something we want enough—like putting in
the effort to apply for a highly competitive job, even if it’s
unlikely we’ll get it. In this framework, a rational actor will
always make choices that they believe will maximize their expected
utility, balancing their desire for a given option with its risks.
Given certain assumptions, their preferences can be described by a
utility function, which can be used to predict their strategies and
choices. Von Neumann’s elegant formulation transmuted subjective
individual desire into a shared frame of reference, defined entirely
by an agent’s actions in a collective playing field. He derived all
of this in the span of a single afternoon. Morgenstern later wrote
in his diary that watching von Neumann solve in one day a problem
that had plagued economists for years “gave me great satisfaction,
and moved me so much that afterwards I could not think about
anything else.” (page 66)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This presentation of von Neumann as a 10x genius is interesting.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>“In game theory, players’ preferences are usually assumed to be
fixed. But psychologists have found that people’s choices are
sensitive to a game’s context. Players behave differently in a
prisoner’s dilemma depending on how it’s presented to them. If it’s
called the Wall Street Game, players are more likely to defect. If
it’s called the Community Game, they’re more likely to cooperate.
The two games have the exact same structure, payoffs, and penalties
(e.g., jail time), yet their titles alone cause players to act
differently.” (page 76)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>“Game theory, pioneered by a traumatized man hoping to plumb the
depths of human nature, has only ever been about math: the dynamics
of a maximizing function, not of real people. We must be careful not
to let its models mean anything about ourselves, and careful to
prevent its fables from seeping into the domain of accepted wisdom.
Let’s consider the zero-sum bias. People across the globe tend to
believe that all resources are limited, even when this is not the
case. An isolationist might oppose immigration because they think
that immigrants “steal” from a fixed number of available jobs, not
realizing that immigrants also drive economic growth and create new
jobs.” (page 80)</p>
<p>“Game theory’s power lies in its expressiveness: it can convey
dynamic stories with simple mechanics. Unfortunately, game theory
has been used to launder dubious beliefs and present racist,
nativist policies as objective or inevitable. Some of these sinister
fables have been taken out of context and integrated into the
foundations of accepted common sense. If game theory continues to be
used as a model of human behavior, it needs major revisions to
reflect the fact that most people aren’t singularly focused on
personal gain. Even then, we’d be better off modeling people for
what they are: flexible learners.” (page 86)</p>
<p>“In his book <em>Economic Fables</em>, mathematician Ariel Rubinstein
likens game theory—mathematical abstractions of complex
situations—to fables with oversimple morals. We should be careful
not to mistake these for reality. Game theory should be studied for
its mathematical beauty, but it cannot pretend to tell us about the
real world. Rubinstein argues that even many academics don’t fully
understand it and often fail to communicate its limitations. This
would not be an issue if game theory remained a purely academic
pursuit. But it’s been adopted for use in modern systems that impact
billions of people worldwide.” (page 98)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>“In 1930, Fisher collected and extended his genetic insights in his
opus, The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection, which almost
single-handedly revitalized Darwin’s ideas and rescued them from
years of neglect by academics. In the book, Fisher elaborates—in his
characteristically cryptic style—what is now one of the most
celebrated arguments in evolutionary biology and an early seed of
game-theoretic thinking in the life sciences.” (page 113)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The part I'm interested in here is that Fisher is said to have a
"characteristically cryptic style." This is the guy who wrote
"Statistical Methods for Research Workers" and "The Design of
Experiments." Is his cryptic style part of why frequentist statistics
is such a poorly understood mess?</p>

invites misuse from researchers unfamiliar with its nuances. Some
have dismissed it as a tautology, nothing more than a statistical
identity. Others have praised its depth.” (page 123)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Games remain an impressive way to evaluate a program’s
capabilities. In the early 1980s, graduate students Shafi Goldwasser
and Silvio Micali invented a powerful new form of mathematical proof
by imagining how they might play a secure poker game over the phone.
The resulting technique, interactive proof systems, consists of two
subparts, a prover and a verifier. These exchange messages until the
verifier is “convinced” that an answer is correct. Interactive
proofs became a foundational technique in computer science and
cryptography. They’re also the metaphoric heart of how we hope to
verify intelligence through games. Traditional math proofs are
inevitable, each step an irresistible conclusion unfolding from the
last. Interactive proofs, on the other hand, are probabilistically
true. By testing again and again, the verifier becomes increasingly
convinced of the prover’s claim. The Turing test, for instance, can
be mathematically formalized in this framework. Games take the same
form: human experts repeatedly test a game-playing computer program
to convince themselves of its capabilities. There is no single
measure of intelligence, or its mechanical approximation. Its
evaluation will be, by nature, interactive: the iterated probing of
a system.” (pages 137-138)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>“To borrow social theorist Sherry Turkle’s phrase, we too easily
abdicate authority to simulations. Simulations are ultimately
constrained by their creators’ assumptions: games are self-contained
universes ticking along to preprogrammed logic. They don’t
necessarily reflect anything fundamental about the world. Models’
conclusions are less interesting than the assumptions on which
they’re based—assumptions that are typically hidden.” (page 159)</p>

path history can take, a dynamic, tumultuous, agonizing process,
with no end. Struggle forever.” (page 160, quoting Kim Stanley
Robinson)</p>
<p>“The game Moksha Patam (today’s Snakes and Ladders) is often
credited to the thirteenth-century Marathi saint Dnyaneshwar, though
it may have been invented hundreds of years earlier. It was designed
to teach players about karma and illustrate the precarity of fate.
In it, souls ascend to the heavenly realms, dragged down by vices
(snakes) and buoyed by virtues (ladders). Snakes are labeled with
the names of demons and the vices they represent, and players
recount stories from Hindu mythology as they play.” (page 160)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>“Scholars have sought to find a purely logical foundation for the
question of morality and how society should be structured. In the
mid-twentieth century, philosopher John Rawls began a line of
inquiry that culminated in his celebrated 1971 treatise, <em>A Theory
of Justice</em>. In this work, he posits fairness as the foundational
principle, or “first virtue,” on which society should be built.”
(page 163)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>“In the 1950s, game theorists discovered that some repeated games
support an infinite number of stable equilibrium strategies. This
became known as the folk theorem, because it was such an obvious
outcome that no one bothered formally publishing it.” (page 165)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>“Board game designer Reiner Knizia claims that the scoring system is
the most important part of designing a new game. It’s the score that
drives players’ behaviors. Similarly, in a subfield of game theory
known as mechanism design, or reverse game theory, mathematicians
design institutional rules that incentivize players to behave in
particular ways.” (page 174)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is pretty neat. Start with the end in mind, and then rather than
thinking we can influence people directly, imagine we can control "the
rules of the game" (through policy, etc.) - how do they get set up to
achieve the desired end? Possible connection also to "nudge" ideas,
etc.</p>

<title>(Audio) The Next Millionaire Next Door</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>It's sweet that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_J._Stanley">Stanley</a>'s daughter finished this 2020 follow-up to
his 1996 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Millionaire_Next_Door">Millionaire Next Door</a> after he died in 2015. There are
refreshed surveys, but not a lot that's new, as far as I can tell,
apart from attempts to defend the family legacy from criticism.</p>
<p>The core concept is still spending less money than you get. More pages
are given to spending less than to getting more. Conscientiousness and
discipline are emphasized. America is presented as uniquely suited to
building wealth because of freedom.</p>
<p>One criticism of the original book was that the core thesis (that
normal people can become millionaires) was an artifact of survivorship
bias observed toward the end of a bull market. I didn't hear a really
good response to this criticism, but I don't think it's a particularly
interesting criticism either.</p>
<p>I think the deeper latent criticism is about what level of the system
to blame. Stanley is all about the individual level. "The game is
winnable!" he says. Critics, I think, are often talking about
something fundamentally different. "The rules of the game are unfair!"
they say. Both these things can be true at the same time.</p>
<p>It's easy to wag a finger at someone with a high income who's still
barely making their house and car payments. But far more people have
low income, not much room to cut expenses, and little opportunity to
increase their income. These books have more advice for the former
than the latter.</p>

<title>Matilda, by Dahl</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>A local middle school put on Matilda, the musical, which made me
curious enough to read the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matilda_(novel)">book</a>. It's strange and cute. It's very
episodic, with the main resolution appearing with less warning in the
book than the musical. Apparently in early versions of the book
Matilda was even more malicious.</p>
<p><img alt="cover" src="cover.jpg"></p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"It's not fair," Lavender said. "How can she do it and we can't?"
(page 69)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"You are so much wiser than your years, my dear," Miss Honey went
on, "that it quite staggers me. Although you look like a child, you
are not really a child at all because your mind and your powers of
reasoning seem to be fully grown-up. So I suppose we might call you
a grown-up child, if you see what I mean." (page 189)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Without stories we're just eating machines with shoes." (Dennis
Kelly, script-writer for the musical, in an afterward)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tim Minchin did the music and lyrics for the musical. He also did

<title>Financial calculators exist</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>When you take the <a href="/20241123-what_are_cfps_supposed_to_know/" title="Certified Financial Planner">CFP</a> exam, you are allowed to use a
<a href="https://www.cfp.net/-/media/files/cfp-board/cfp-certification/exam/calculator-policy.pdf">dedicated financial calculator</a> like the Texas Instruments
"Business Analyst" <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Texas-Instruments-Advanced-Financial-Calculator/dp/B0029F1OKE">BA II Plus</a>. How wild is that?</p>
<p><img alt="calculator" src="ba2plus.jpg"></p>
<p>What does it do? You can start to guess from buttons like "IRR," but
the <a href="https://education.ti.com/en/guidebook/details/en/ADF11FB65B284B6195B0A7E9502784BA/baiiplus">manual</a> explains much more about how the functionality is
organized into "worksheets" and so on.</p>
<p><img alt="functions" src="functions.png"></p>
<p>Do people use these for real, in their work? My guess is that they're
sort of an archaic thing that persists only for the exam? Surely
people use one of many <a href="https://www.calculator.net/finance-calculator.html">online calculators</a>, or Excel, or some other
more user-friendly tool? (Although I don't really know what a great
example is; most of the ones I see at a quick look seem pretty
crummy...)</p>

<title>What are CFPs supposed to know?</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>To be a Certified Financial Planner, you have to have a bachelor's
degree (in anything) and do (<a href="https://www.cfp.net/get-certified/certification-process/education-requirement/certification-coursework-requirement/accelerated-path">usually</a>) seven <a href="https://www.cfp.net/">CFP Board</a>-approved
classes and pass a test covering many <a href="https://www.cfp.net/get-certified/certification-process/education-requirement/certification-coursework-requirement/what-youll-learn">topics</a>. The classes are
Fundamentals, Insurance, Investments, Tax, Retirement, Estate, and a
capstone case study class. Then you do 30 hours of continuing
education every two years.</p>
<p>The CFP Board <a href="https://www.cfp.net/get-certified/certification-process/education-requirement/certification-coursework-requirement/find-an-education-program/">lists</a> about 250 institutions with approved
offerings, mostly universities. These can be outsourced offerings, for
example from <a href="https://cerifi.com/">Cerifi</a>'s <a href="https://dalton-education.com/university-partnerships">Dalton Education</a> or
<a href="https://www.greeneconsults.com/">Greene Consulting</a>'s <a href="https://www.financialplannerprogram.com/#school">Financial Planner Program</a> or <a href="https://www.kenzahn.com/">Zahn</a>.</p>
<p>There seem to be two main lines of textbooks. One is <a href="https://cerifi.com/">Cerifi</a>'s
<a href="https://www.money-education.com/">Money Education</a>, which <a href="https://cerifi.com/our-brands">claims</a> to by “chosen by 200
universities nationwide.” The <a href="https://www.nationalunderwriter.com/series/academic.html">other</a> is from
<a href="https://www.nationalunderwriter.com/">National Underwriter</a>, mostly in their <a href="https://www.nationalunderwriter.com/series/the-leimberg-library.html">Leimberg Library</a>. There
used to be books from Keir, but they <a href="https://www.keirsuccess.com/products/cfp-certification-products/education-courses/university-textbooks">joined forces</a> with
<a href="https://www.money-education.com/">Money Education</a>.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.opensyllabus.org/">Open Syllabus</a>, it isn't clear which books are most popular. I
find <a href="https://analytics.opensyllabus.org/record/works?syllabus_query=money+education">one entry each</a> for two of the Money Education books, and
<a href="https://analytics.opensyllabus.org/record/works?syllabus_query=leimberg">no mention</a> of Leimberg books. It seems like <a href="https://www.cffp.edu/cfp-education">Kaplan</a> and
<a href="https://www.brettdanko.com/">Danko</a> also have materials, but may only offer them to participants
in their courses.</p>
<p>There are also lots of exam prep and study materials. <a href="https://www.kenzahn.com/">Zahn</a> for
example makes supplemental books and flashcards, and Money Education
has “QuickSheets.”</p>
<p>There's also a thing called a <a href="/20241123-financial_calculators_exist/">financial calculator</a>, which can be a
physical object that CFPs may learn to use.</p>
<p>For continuing education, every two years a CFP has to do 30 hours of
programs, selected from <a href="https://www.cfp.net/career-and-growth/continuing-education/find-a-ce-program">thousands</a> that are approved by the CFP
Board.</p>
