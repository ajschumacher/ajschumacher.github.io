<h1>Bayes' Rule for Ducks</h1>
<p class="date">Sunday February 23, 2014</p>
<p>You look at a thing.</p>
<p><a href="mandarin-duck-arp.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-855" alt="duck?" src="mandarin-duck-arp.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Is it a duck?</p>
<p>Re-phrase: What is the probability that it's a duck, if it looks like that?</p>
<p>Bayes' rule says that the probability of it being a duck, if it looks like that, is the same as the probability of any old thing being a duck, times the probability of a duck looking like that, divided by the probability of a thing looking like that.</p>
<p>\[ Pr(duck | looks) = \frac{Pr(duck) \cdot Pr(looks | duck)}{Pr(looks)} \]</p>
<p>This makes sense:</p>
<ul>
<li>If ducks are mythical beasts, then \( Pr(duck) \) (our "prior" on ducks) is very low, and the thing would have to be <em>very</em> duck-like before we'd believe it's a duck. On the other hand, if we're at some sort of duck farm, then \( Pr(duck) \) is high and anything that looks even a little like a duck is probably a duck.</li>
<li>If it's very likely that a duck would look like that (\( Pr(looks|duck) \) is high) then we're more likely to think it's a duck. This is the "likelihood" of a duck looking like that thing. In practice it's based on how the ducks we've seen before have looked.</li>
<li>The denominator \( Pr(looks) \) normalizes things. After all, we're in some sense portioning out the probabilities of this thing being whatever it could be. If 1% of things look like this, and 1% of things look like this <em>and</em> are ducks, then 100% of things that look like this are ducks. So \( Pr(looks) \) is what we're working with; it's the denominator.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's an example of a strange world to test this in:</p>
<p><a href="screen-shot-2014-02-23-at-5-44-22-pm.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-839" alt="ducks" src="screen-shot-2014-02-23-at-5-44-22-pm.png"></a></p>
<p>There are ten things. Six of them are ducks. Five of them look like ducks. Four of them both look like ducks and are ducks. One thing looks like a duck but is not a duck. Maybe it's a fake duck? Two ducks do not look like ducks. Ducks in camouflage. Test the equality of the two sides of Bayes' rule:</p>
<p>\[ Pr(duck | looks) = \frac{Pr(duck) \cdot Pr(looks | duck)}{Pr(looks)} \]</p>
<p>\[ \frac{4}{5} = \frac{\frac{6}{10} \cdot \frac{4}{6}}{\frac{5}{10}} \]</p>
<p>It's true here, and it's not hard to show that it must be true, using two ways of expressing the probability of being a duck and looking like a duck. We have both of these:</p>
<p>\[ Pr(duck \cap looks) = Pr(duck|looks) \cdot Pr(looks) \]</p>
<p>\[ \displaystyle Pr(duck \cap looks) = Pr(looks|duck) \cdot Pr(duck) \]</p>
<p>Check those with the example as well, if you like. Using the equality, we get:</p>
<p>\[ Pr(duck|looks) \cdot Pr(looks) = Pr(looks|duck) \cdot Pr(duck) \]</p>
<p>Then dividing by \( Pr(looks) \) we have Bayes' rule, as above.</p>
<p>\[ Pr(duck | looks) = \frac{Pr(duck) \cdot Pr(looks | duck)}{Pr(looks)} \]</p>
<p>This is not a difficult proof at all, but for many people the result feels very unintuitive. I've tried to explain it <a href="http://planspace.org/2013/11/11/whats-the-difference-between-bayesian-and-non-bayesian-statistics/">once before</a> in the context of statistical claims. Of course there's a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes'_theorem">wikipedia page</a> and <a href="http://betterexplained.com/articles/an-intuitive-and-short-explanation-of-bayes-theorem/">many</a> <a href="http://yudkowsky.net/rational/bayes">other</a> <a href="http://www.quora.com/Probability/What-is-an-intuitive-explanation-of-Bayes-Rule">resources</a>. I wanted to try to do it with a unifying simple example that makes the equations easy to parse, and this is what I've come up with.</p>
