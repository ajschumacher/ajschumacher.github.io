<h1>Aims of Education</h1>
<p class="date">Saturday January 11, 2014</p>
<p><a href="http://worrydream.com/">Bret Victor</a> put up his <a href="http://worrydream.com/Links2013/">links for 2013</a>, and one of them
particularly caught my eye:
<a href="http://www.sfu.ca/~egan/Difficult-article.html">Why education is so difficult and contentious</a>, by Kieran Egan,
which says that there are three conflicting goals of education. This
reminded me of a paper I wrote back when I was getting my master of
arts in teaching. I was able to find the paper, and sure enough I had
been responding to related writing also by Egan. The difficulty with
identifying the goal of education, I think, is that it's ultimately a
pretty big question. What is the meaning of life? Why are we here? In
my paper I tried to move toward articulating a coherent goal of
education. I think the paper did not really succeed completely, but it
was a step. Here it is, exactly as it was in 2006.</p>

<h3>The Aim of Education</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Man is a tame or civilized animal ; nevertheless he requires proper
instruction and a fortunate nature, and then of all animals he
becomes the most divine and most civilized ; but if insufficiently
or ill educated, he becomes the savagest of earthly creatures.
Wherefore the legislator ought not to allow the education of
children to become a secondary or accidental matter. (Plato, quoted
from <em>Laws</em> in Frank, 1947, p. 291)</p>
<p>The ideal aim of education is creation of power of self-control.
(Dewey, 1938/1997, p. 64)</p>
<p>The safest general characterization of the [Western] philosophical
tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to Plato.
(Whitehead, 1929/1978, p. 39)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Education as an institution, and particularly our typically requisite
kindergarten through twelfth grade, is largely accepted as a necessary
and good thing. The mission of the U.S. Department of Education
includes “assuring access to equal educational opportunity for every
individual” and promoting “improvements in the quality and usefulness
of education” (Department of Education Organization Act, 1979). It
does not specify, however, what use it is that education should have.
This ambiguity of purpose can cloud discussions about education. To
evaluate how well a system achieves its goals, it must first be agreed
what the goals are.</p>
<p>Several considerations should inform a discussion of education’s
purpose. First there is the question of how many such purposes there
may be. If there are multiple objectives then in order for education
to succeed they must be compatible. Second, philosophy and pedagogy
must remain clearly differentiated. An aim of education is not the
same thing as a pedagogy.</p>
<p>The underlying question of education’s fundamental aim has
unfortunately been neglected and misunderstood. Students ask why they
have to go to school, and teachers should have a good answer. This
paper considers the work of educational theorists’ in order to
identify a consistent philosophy of education.</p>
<p>Egan (1997) considers the modern school as developing
contemporaneously with the modern hospital and prison. Concerning
prisons, he asserts that they have in the West “two aims – to punish
and to rehabilitate,” and that the incompatibility of these aims leads
to difficulties with the system’s implementation (p. 10). However, it
could also be said that the single aim of the modern prison is to
reduce crime, in which case there is no conflict in the ends but only
in the means. Alternatively, it could be said that the aim of the
prison is simply to house certain individuals away from the general
population, for reasons and durations determined by other systems. It
is important to articulate goals at an appropriate level of
specificity.</p>
<p>Another modification to Egan’s aims for prisons would be to classify
rehabilitation as punishment, in which case there is one goal and it
is punishment, or alternatively that punishments contribute to the one
goal of rehabilitation. Either argument, if accepted, collapses Egan’s
two aims to just one and eliminates the alleged conflict. If two goals
are truly distinct, it is important to establish this clearly.</p>
<p>After prisons, Egan goes on to construct his dilemma for education,
saying that the modern school has not two but three conflicting aims.
The first of these is socialization, “the homogenization of children”
and the production of “a skilled workforce of good citizens” (p. 11).
The second aim is labeled Platonic and focuses on “learning those
forms of knowledge that would give students a privileged, rational
view of reality” (p. 13). Egan attributes the third aim to Rousseau,
with “focus on fulfilling the individual potential of each student” in
accordance with “the nature of students’ development, learning, and
motivation” (p. 15-16). After arguing the incompatibility of these
three, Egan suggests a fourth of his own, sketching a sort of
Vygotskyan recapitulation theory.</p>
<p>There are several problems with Egan’s taxonomy. Prime among these is
a forced mischaracterization of Plato, with whom Egan groups E. D.
Hirsch. Even in Egan’s own words, Plato hoped for students to acquire
“the ability to reflect on ideas, to pull them this way and that,” not
only to acquire an inert body of knowledge (p. 13). Plato and Hirsch
may be similar in as much as they recommend a curriculum, but they
have very different aims. Hirsch’s ideas clearly fall in Egan’s first
category of socialization – his concern is with transmitting a
homogenizing “cultural literacy” in order to ensure, for example, a
“common reader” (Hirsch, 1987).</p>
<p>Plato’s goals for education are being confused with his pedagogy in
Egan’s interpretation. The aims should be considered independent of
the nature or effectiveness of the curriculum. Regarding his
underlying philosophy of education, scholars of <em>The Republic</em> have
noted that Plato was intensely aware of the importance of the
environment in the development of individuals, and that since the
uncultivated environment is often imperfect, it “can be counteracted
only by creating a power for good as penetrating, as unconscious, and
as universal; and to do this is the true function of a public system
of education" (McClintock, 1880/1968, p. 7). Bosanquet offers that
Plato’s school is “the space and atmosphere needed for the human plant
to throw out its branches and flowers in their proper shape,” which
sounds very much like Egan’s third category (1900, p. 12).</p>
<p>Indeed, Egan’s second, “Platonic” category is a phantom, on the one
hand aggrandizing socialization and on the other trivializing the
developmental goals shared by Plato and Rousseau alike. Egan shares
these goals as well, and the “new idea” he offers is pedagogical, a
different route but not a different destination. Egan notes that
Rousseau saw his work as “a kind of supplement to <em>The Republic</em>,” and
upon examination it is clear that there is, beyond pedagogy, no
underlying conflict between Plato and the theorists of Rousseau’s
tradition (p. 15).</p>
<p>After clarification of Egan’s four aims there are only two. The first
is the expansion of the socialization category to include the
transmittance of any inert knowledge, social or otherwise. The
important note here is that transmittance of knowledge as a goal is
different from the use of transmittance of knowledge to achieve other
goals. This goal of transmittance is very specific. It is the goal of
Hirsch, the philosophy of Thorndike, the Lockean model of “the child
as empty vessel or blank slate” (Lillard, 2005, p. 9).</p>
<p>The second category of aim is that of Rousseau, Plato, and Egan, which
has yet to be fully articulated. The lack of explicit language about
this alternative fundamental aim means that in some sense “educators
must establish new goals for learning” (Grabinger, p. 667). This
process can begin with a review of the major relevant educational
theorists starting, as Egan indicates, with the work of John Dewey.</p>
<p>Dewey, “the man acknowledged to be the pre-eminent educational
theorist of the twentieth century,” has conspicuously little to say
about fundamental aims in his <em>Experience and Education</em> (1938/1997).
It reflects the characteristic neglect of the issue that there is so
little in this work explicitly addressing it. One might think the
reason for this is that it is taken for granted, as a closed question,
but it is then a bit surprising when Dewey explicitly claims that "The
ideal aim of education is creation of power of self-control" (p. 64).</p>
<p>This unexpected announcement comes in a discussion of Dewey’s notions
of social control and the true nature of freedom as freedom of
thought, not freedom of action. He argues that thinking is "a
postponement of immediate action" (p. 64). Much more recent
evolutionary theory such as that espoused by Devlin suggests that
"off-line thinking," thought not connected to physical action, is a
key factor differentiating humans from other animals (2000).</p>
<p>Other more recent educational theorists have echoed Dewey more or less
subtly, as illustrated for example in the title of Bandura’s 1997
<em>Self-Efficacy: The Exercise of Control</em>. It was also Bandura who said
that “self-reflection is the most uniquely human characteristic,”
(qtd. in Pajares) aligning with Rousseau’s naturalism in the modern
theory of Devlin and others. This focus on self-control as the product
of education, connected as it is to evolutionary psychology, can then
be viewed as a result of following Rousseau’s advice to “fix your eye
on nature [and] follow the path traced by her” (qtd. in Egan, p. 16).
Piaget said that scientific knowledge is “drawn in large part from
common sense,” referring to his fundamental hypothesis of genetic
epistemology, “that there is a parallelism between the progress made
in the logical and rational organization of knowledge and the
corresponding formative psychological processes.” (1968) This view of
knowledge implies that anything one might learn is in some sense a
result of the nature of humanity – an interesting formalization of the
view that education makes us “more human.”</p>
<p>The two goals then can be contrasted as external versus internal. The
first goal, previously called socialization, is to transmit external
knowledge into the student, enforcing social rules, for example, from
the outside. The second goal, of Rousseau, Dewey, and the rest, is to
develop the student’s natural internal mental faculties. One might
question the extent to which these goals are incompatible, or, if one
were Hirsch, whether the second goal is realistically possible,
meaningful, or adequate.</p>
<p>Dr. Maria Montessori experimentally developed a system of education
that focuses on the work of students, with minimal transmittance in
the usual sense of moving information from teacher or textbook into
the student. She observed that in the proper environment discipline
“sprang up spontaneously” and that from a student body of children
judged passive or domineering, good or bad, “there remain[ed] only one
kind of child” (1967, p. 202). She called this phenomenon
“normalization,” and characterized its discovery as “the most
important single result of [her] whole work” (p. 204). In as much as
the goal of Hirsch is a behaviorist goal, concerned with instilling
good (socially acceptable, beneficial, hard-working) behavior in
students, Montessori provides empirical observations that such
behavior can arise from students themselves, if the school setting is
appropriately constructed. Plato’s interpreters would agree that in
the “proper space and atmosphere” emerges “this divine humanity which
is in the truest sense the self” (Bosanquet, 1900, p. 12; McClintock,
1880/1968, p. 22).</p>
<p>Our faith in human nature can extend beyond behavior of this kind, and
in particular to language. Human children learn to speak and
understand their native language without being explicitly taught – an
often neglected marvel. Montessori herself noticed “the many wonders
of the language mechanism,” anticipating in some ways the modern
linguistics often identified with Noam Chomsky, that “there is
something special about the human mind that equips it to acquire
language” (Montessori, 1967, p. 116; O'Grady, Archibald, Aronoff, &amp;
Rees-Miller, 2005, p. 390). In this view, language is not learned only
from external sources, but is to a degree inborn in all humans as a
“Universal Grammar.” This theory is supported by a number of
arguments, as well as the apparent existence of a critical period for
language learning (O'Grady, Archibald, Aronoff, &amp; Rees-Miller, 2005).</p>
<p>One’s native language is typically learned before schooling begins,
but the nativist idea extends beyond language. For example, the
principal claim of Devlin’s <em>The Math Gene</em> is that “the feature of
our brain that enables us to use language is the same feature that
makes it possible for us to do mathematics” (p. 70). Since everyone
has the capacity for language, everyone has the capacity for
mathematics – a traditional bastion of education. The reason people
appear to vary so much more in mathematical fluency than in linguistic
fluency is then a combination of the differences in environments that
people are exposed to and the unnatural forms that are imposed by
traditional education on mathematics.</p>
<p>At least in these three areas – behavior, language, and mathematics –
theory and research support the view that they are natural human
abilities and so are definitely developed in accordance with the
second or naturalist goal for education. Generalizing broadly, it can
be said that anything humans do, no matter how far removed from the
struggle for survival, is by definition a naturally human behavior. In
this way anything one might want to transmit to a student was produced
by someone, and could also be produced by the student. There is no
real conflict between “natural” and “school” capabilities; the second
goal can achieve the aims of the first as well.</p>
<p>The converse, that inculcation of knowledge should develop the mental
faculties of the student, is not so clear, and in fact it seems not to
be true in general. Research indicates that “knowledge acquired in
abstract circumstances without direct relevance to the needs of
learners is not readily available for application or transfer to novel
situations” (Grabinger). It seems that learning many facts or examples
does not always lead to mental generalized concepts or what Beers and
others call metacognitive skills. As Beers asked a teacher who had
just spent a class explaining one short story to her class, “what did
you show them that they could use with another story?” (Beers, 51)</p>
<p>Standardized tests provide a good illustration of this point. Although
of course such tests vary in quality, test-takers with advanced
cognitive skills provided even meager content exposure can generally
be expected to test well. Those with extensive externally collected
content knowledge may have positive results on the relevant tests, but
will not necessarily develop cognitive skills in the process of
internalizing this data. Their knowledge is not a transferable,
applicable, and hence not a useful, thing. So while well-written
standardized tests may provide a rough measure of cognitive ability,
they encourage or at least allow the test-specific alternative.</p>
<p>Important mental skills are not served well by this first goal. As
Grabinger reports, there is a difference between intentional and
incidental learning (p. 672). Hirsch’s own 1898 dissertation research
showed that a teacher’s instruction in one specific task did not help
students perform other related tasks. Hirsch concluded that the
problem was with the human mind rather than with the nature of the
instruction or evaluation. The Deweyan goal for education provides a
necessary alternative to this bleak outlook.</p>
<p>Jerome Bruner "take[s] as perhaps the most general objective of
education that it cultivate excellence" and explains that this goal
means "helping each student achieve his [or her] optimum intellectual
development" (1960/1977, p. 9). What is meant by "excellence" or
"optimum intellectual development" is not necessarily well-defined.
Firstly, "optimum" may imply a stopping point. This language can
however be alternatively understood to not contradict the common
sentiment that one should always "desire to go on learning," so that
it is this process of learning that proceeds optimally rather than
merely reaching an optimal level (Dewey, 1938/1997, p. 48). Secondly,
specifying <em>each student’s</em> optimum begs the question of how much
students might vary and how this should be taken into consideration.</p>
<p>Since education cannot very well affect the genetic nature of
students, one would hope that the natural endowments of students would
not vary too wildly, and this appears to be the case. The three
examples above, most notably the cognitive capability for mathematics,
are human universals. Humans are genetically more similar than
different, and the degree to which internal characteristics appear
depends largely on the outside environment (Ridley, 2003). Across many
fields, “the preponderance of psychological evidence indicates that
experts are made, not born” (Ross, 2006).</p>
<p>Having analyzed the developmental aim of education, some consideration
of how it may affect the substance of education is in order. Neither
category of goal specifies a particular classroom, content, pedagogy,
and so forth, but the second goal does not even specify that there
might be a fixed curriculum at all. However, neither does it preclude
fixed content or systems of instruction – in fact all the major
theorists demand structure of some kind in education (eg. Dewey,
Montessori). While it is not specified that schools should include a
fixed list of disciplines for study, the second goal certainly allows
for them, and provides an overarching principle for organizing and
motivating their instruction. Considering the example of language, we
see that children learn to speak and understand through immersion in
speech communities in which they are free to participate fully – this
can provide a model for what we call “learning communities.” Schools
provide communities that might not be available elsewhere, identified
by rigorous, disciplined thought, where teachers should provide
examples of the appropriate fluencies.</p>
<p>The educational goal of developing students’ intellectual abilities is
well-founded in this analysis. Students possess natural capabilities
that may be brought out by education, and in fact anything that might
be taught can be so developed naturally. It is a more robust goal as
compared to the transmittance of knowledge alone, since it can
effectively encourage the other while the reverse is questionable. It
is a goal that can benefit all students, and it is the goal advocated,
explicitly or not, by nearly all modern philosophers of education.
Arriving at this goal provides a solid foundation from which to build
educational programs and evaluate existing systems, but it is clearly
a starting and not a finishing point. Important questions of what
intellectual faculties are and how they can be developed remain, only
hinted at herein. As with all things, it is important to identify and
understand the questions before one can reasonably hope to find
answers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are all aware, probably, that the word “school” is derived from a
Greek word meaning “leisure.” This conception of “leisure” is one of
the greatest ideas that the Greeks have left us. It is not that of
amusement or holiday-making. It is opposed both to this and to the
pressure of bread-winning industry, and indicates, as it were, the
space and atmosphere needed for the human plant to throw out its
branches and flowers in their proper shape. “To have leisure for”
any occupation, was to devote yourself to it freely, because your
mind demanded it ; to make it, as it were, your hobby. It does not
imply useless work, but it implies work done for the love of it. In
the modern world leisure is a hard thing to get ; and yet, wherever
a mind is really and truly growing, the spirit of leisure is there.
It is worth thinking of, how far in education the idea of the growth
of a mind can be made the central point, so that the things which
are considered worth teaching may really have time to sink into and
to nourish the whole human being, morally and intellectually alike.
(Bosanquet, 1900, p. 11-12)</p>
