<h1>The Big Con, by Maurer</h1>
<p class="date">Sunday February 14, 2021</p>
<p>Published in 1940, WWI was "the War" (page 28), WWII was "the present
European War" (page 311), there were thousand-dollar <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/6-famous-discontinued-and-uncommon-u-s-currency-denominations-4773302#1000-bill">G-notes</a>, and
there was quite a lot of sexism and racism (throughout). Instead of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam">emails from Nigerian princes</a>, you might see a classified ad in the
paper "For an honest, reliable businessman with $20,000 to invest for
a large return." (page 115) There were elaborate plots! Would you
really not fall for anything like that? What are people falling for
these days? Quite a lot! What a world, what a world.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"After all, a look around present-day American institutions should
suffice to demonstrate that the character in question has now fully
emerged from the underworld and entered the mainstream, where he may
be far less colorful and imaginative, but no less on the grift."
(page xv, from the introduction by Luc Sante)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Their methods differ more in degree than in kind from those
employed by more legitimate forms of business." (page 3)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"The three big-con games, the <em>wire</em>, the <em>rag</em>, and the <em>pay-off</em>."
(page 3)</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><em>the wire</em>: "A big-con game in which the insideman (passing as a
   Western Union official) convinces the mark that he can delay the
   race results going to the book-makers long enough for the mark to
   place a bet after the race is run. The roper makes a mistake and
   the mark loses."</li>
<li><em>the rag</em>: "An intricate big-con game very similar to the pay-off,
   except that stocks are used instead of races. The insideman poses
   as an agent for a broker's syndicate which is trying to break the
   bucket-shops. The mark profits on several investments, is sent for
   a large sum of money, and is fleeced."</li>
<li><em>the pay-off</em>: "The most lucrative of all big-con games, with
   touches running from $10,000 up, with those of $100,000 being
   common. It operates on the principle that a wealthy mark is induced
   to believe that he has been taken into a deal whereby a large
   racing syndicate is to be swindled. At first he pays with money
   furnished him by the confidence men, then is put on the send for
   all the cash he can raise, fleeced, and blown off. The pay-off
   (invented in 1906) evolved from the short-pay at the track and was
   fully developed by 1910, when the big stores appeared in many of
   the larger cities."</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>"Most marks come from the upper strata of society, which, in
America, means that they have made, married, or inherited money.
Because of this, they acquire status which in time they come to
attribute to some inherent superiority, especially as regards
matters of sound judgment in finance and investment. Friends and
associates, themselves social climbers and sycophants, help to
maintain this illusion of superiority. Eventually, the mark comes to
regard himself as a person of vision and even of genius. Thus a
Babbitt who has cleared half a million in a real-estate development
easily forgets the part which luck and chicanery have played in his
financial rise; he accepts his mantle of respectability without
question; he naïvely attributes his success to sound business
judgment. And any confidence man will testify that a real-estate man
is the fattest and juiciest of suckers." (page 104)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Religious scruples often seem to fail a mark at the crucial
moment." (page 105)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>""Larceny," or thieves' blood, runs not only in the veins of
professional thieves; it would appear that humanity at large has
just a dash of it–and sometimes more." (page 117)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Many con men feel that marks have one characteristic in common–they
are all liars." (page 118)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Such institutions [schools for grifters] have long been the delight
of fictioneers, but there is no reliable evidence to indicate that
they ever functioned in the American underworld." (page 160)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>The author references on page 164 "Dan the Dude's place at 28 W. 28th
St." as being a hangout for con men. It has been otherwise known as
well, <a href="https://ephemeralnewyork.wordpress.com/tag/28-west-28th-street/">it seems</a>.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"When we think of cheese, it's Wisconsin; when we speak of oil, it's
Pennsylvania; but with grifters, it's Indiana." (page 173)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"If fifty of them [con men] were selected and mixed indiscriminately
with a group of successful business and professional men, all the
correlations and statistics of a Hooton or a Lombroso would not set
them apart; and, if a census of opinions upon politics, ethics,
religion, or what-not were taken from the entire group, not even a
Solomon could separate the sheep from the goats on the basis of
their social views. If confidence men operate outside the law, it
must be remembered that they are not much further outside than many
of our pillars of society who go under names less sinister. They
only carry to an ultimate and very logical conclusion certain trends
which are often inherent in various forms of legitimate business."

<blockquote>
<p>"The <em>short deck</em>. A short-con game operated by a man who drops one
card out of a deck he has offered to sell a mark very cheaply. They
argue over whether or not it is a full deck, then bet. The mark
thinks the deck is short one card, but the operator produces a full
deck." (page 304)</p>
