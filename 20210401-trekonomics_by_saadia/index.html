<h1>Trekonomics, by Saadia</h1>
<p class="date">Thursday April  1, 2021</p>
<p>This is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trekonomics">best book</a> on Star Trek economics that I've read
(sorry, <a href="/20201109-economics_of_star_trek_by_webb/" title="The Economics of Star Trek, by Webb">Webb</a>). Personal, erudite, and optimistic, <a href="https://www.inkshares.com/books/trekonomics">it</a> suggests
that post-scarcity has started, and that while there's still a long
way to go, we can work merrily to advance farther.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"It is almost a paradox to state it this way, but in a society where
nothing is scarce and consequently where work is no longer a
prerequisite for survival, finding good reasons to work becomes
paramount, the defining existential question that everyone has to
ask themselves." (pages 44-45)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"For those who can't swing it, the imperative to build a meaningful
life through work becomes a source of unbearable anxiety." (page 58)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RepRap_project">RepRap project</a> to make a 3D printer that can print copies of
itself is pretty neat!</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"As with most open-source projects, what is learned and invented
along the way is as valuable as the stated goal." (page 79)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFM_International_LEAP">LEAP</a> stands for "Leading Edge Aviation Propulsion."</p>
<hr />
<p>On page 86 he mentions "Pareto improvement" which refers to a change
that helps something and hurts nothing else, which is a neat idea from
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency">Pareto efficiency</a> (not to be confused with the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">Pareto principle</a>). I think a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic">ROC curve</a> should represent a
Pareto frontier...</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Empirical data suggests that given enough time, all rival goods are
either substituted or become nonrival." (page 100)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>The emphasis on reputation as a motivator is interesting. Thinking of
modern social media, which is a kind of focus on reputation, it seems
like a system with risks. It matters whose opinion you value. If you
spend all your time on public reputation management and none on quiet
work, for example, reputation may be a distraction rather than a
focusing agent.</p>
<hr />
<p>There's some fairly naive exponential extrapolation of economic
productivity to the 24th century... Seems like some discussion of
exponential vs. sigmoid might be appropriate...</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Our culture hungers for the cheap thrills of apocalypse." (page
106)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"News of our imminent demise has been greatly exaggerated." (page
107)</p>
</blockquote>

Institutions for Collective Action</em> (Cambridge: Cambridge University
Press, 1990), p. 183. It is hands-down one of the most important
books of the past fifty years."</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Without rules or regulations, be they self-imposed or enforced by
an external intrumentality (an agency or a government),
overconsumption is almost always guaranteed. Such rules and
regulations are extremely hard to devise, and enforcement is very
complex." (page 121)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Thanks to science and political activism, we mustered the power to
ban lead in domestic products. However, the public health
consequences and the costs borne by society were enormous (including
but not limited to widespread disruption of prefrontal cortex
development in children, leading to significant increases in violent
crime). We let oil and car companies free ride on the back of
society. It would have taken much longer to ban lead had it not been
for the heroic work of Caltech geochemist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clair_Cameron_Patterson">Clair Patterson</a>."
(page 122)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Free riding takes place at a myriad of points in the overall
system, from individuals to corporations to states. Many private
economic actors routinely engage in various forms of legal and
illegal tax evasion, weakening the very same public institutions
that help and guarantee their business. This is free riding, but on
government. The usual self-servicing argument that everybody does it
anyway does not make the practice any less craven or repellent. The
managers and stockholders of these multinational corporations are
perfectly aware that they are breaching the contract between their
companies and society as a whole. Basically, they behave no better
than Third World dictators who stuff stolen cash in Swiss vaults.
Only a residual sense of guilt about the extent of their free riding
makes them publicize their paltry philanthropic efforts and their
so-called corporate-citizenship initiatives. They operate with the
dread of getting caught, and thus aggressively support political
parties, economists, and opinion makers who agitate against taxes
out of naive philosophical principles. The perverse result is that
all too often and in too many countries, the party of the free
market, which in truth should defend open society, progress, and
civic spirit, ends up as the party of tax evasion, monopoly, and
free riding." (page 124)</p>

<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dispossessed"><em>The Dispossessed</em></a> specifically makes the case that
post-scarcity is not so much a matter of material wealth or natural
bounty, but an organizational option for society." (page 143)</p>

<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"By the time <em>Next Generation</em> rolls around, the conflict between
the messy present and the aspirational future has been resolved.
Stoicism has won. The <em>Enterprise</em>'s new crew is all Spock and no
Kirk." (page 172)</p>

<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Even more pointedly, if we take a step back from Hollywood's
romance of space travel, with its gizmos and its aliens, we may soon
come to the rather disquieting realization that we <em>already</em> live in
Keynes's, and therefore <em>Star Trek</em>'s, cornucopia. Economic bliss is
just very unevenly distributed, to paraphrase science-fiction author
William Gibson." (page 211)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"If you believe that <em>Star Trek</em> is about space travel, you are
taking it too literally." (page 215)</p>

<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"While nominally the subject of monetary transactions, everything
that matters is as good as free to many of us. When allocation
decisions consist in choosing between your new iPhone
storage-capacity options or the trim of the car, then you know you
have whittled down your ninety-nine problems to the last few
marginal ones. For all intents and purposes, and save for a few
minor imperfections, the global economy already acts as one massive
replicator." (page 232)</p>
