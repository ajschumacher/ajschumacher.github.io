# Trekonomics, by Saadia

This is the [best book][] on Star Trek economics that I've read
(sorry, [Webb][]). Personal, erudite, and optimistic, [it][] suggests
that post-scarcity has started, and that while there's still a long
way to go, we can work merrily to advance farther.

> "It is almost a paradox to state it this way, but in a society where

> prerequisite for survival, finding good reasons to work becomes
> paramount, the defining existential question that everyone has to
> ask themselves." (pages 44-45)

The [RepRap project][] to make a 3D printer that can print copies of
itself is pretty neat!

On page 86 he mentions "Pareto improvement" which refers to a change
that helps something and hurts nothing else, which is a neat idea from
[Pareto efficiency][] (not to be confused with the
[Pareto principle][]). I think a [ROC curve][] should represent a
Pareto frontier...

The emphasis on reputation as a motivator is interesting. Thinking of
modern social media, which is a kind of focus on reputation, it seems
like a system with risks. It matters whose opinion you value. If you
spend all your time on public reputation management and none on quiet
work, for example, reputation may be a distraction rather than a
focusing agent.

There's some fairly naive exponential extrapolation of economic
productivity to the 24th century... Seems like some discussion of
exponential vs. sigmoid might be appropriate...

> "Free riding takes place at a myriad of points in the overall

> government. The usual self-servicing argument that everybody does it
> anyway does not make the practice any less craven or repellent. The
> managers and stockholders of these multinational corporations are
> perfectly aware that they are breaching the contract between their
> companies and society as a whole. Basically, they behave no better
> than Third World dictators who stuff stolen cash in Swiss vaults.
> Only a residual sense of guilt about the extent of their free riding
> makes them publicize their paltry philanthropic efforts and their
> so-called corporate-citizenship initiatives. They operate with the
> dread of getting caught, and thus aggressively support political
> parties, economists, and opinion makers who agitate against taxes
> out of naive philosophical principles. The perverse result is that
> all too often and in too many countries, the party of the free
> market, which in truth should defend open society, progress, and
> civic spirit, ends up as the party of tax evasion, monopoly, and
> free riding." (page 124)
