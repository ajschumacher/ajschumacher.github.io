# Everybody Lies, by Stephens-Davidowitz

I finally read my copy of this [book][], which is a final form of the
author's collected [research][] using "non-traditional" data, chiefly
Google search data. The contribution of [racism][] to Trump's election
is a headline claim. I don't know that I'm as optimistic as the author
that these techniques all yield uniformly stronger claims than
"conventional" research.

This is citing Hal Varian's [Big Data: New Tricks for Econometrics](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.28.2.3).

On page 57 he mentions "[Google Correlate][]," which seems neat
("Google Trends in reverse") and was publicly available from 2011 to
2019.

He's going through a sort of "Moneyball for X" survey of people:

 * Horse racing: Jeff Seder
 * Wine: Orley Ashenfelter

> "The second lesson is that, when trying to make predictions, you
> needn't worry too much about why your models work."

> "The final lesson to be learned from Seder's successful attempt to

> and flexible in determining what counts as data." (pages 71-74)

On page 91, he references a [study][] that provides quantitative
evidence for Vonnegut's [Shapes of Stories][].

This kind of thing is fascinating to me–private conspiracy theories
that are self-protecting and secretly mislead those who form them. I
imagine that many racist people, "proud boys," etc. believe that most
people agree with them but hide their belief. See also expressions
like "He's saying what we're all thinking," which is a statement that is difficult to verify.

Around page 144, he's talking about how the internet is less
segregated than you might think, in terms of people of all political
persuasions reading the most popular news sites and so on. He points
out also that "a surprising amount of the information people get on
Facebook comes from people with opposing views." This makes me wonder
how much the perception/reality of increased polarization is _caused
by_ more communication and exposure to different views. If I never
hear about my aunt's crazy beliefs, I'm less likely to get upset about
them and feel like I need to advocate against them. Maybe hearing
about anti-racism makes some people more racist? Hmm.

This is not a critique that is specific to government data...

This is sort of an interesting look at success for the masses versus
success for the few, or at least at different levels/types of
"success"... A possible hypothesis might be that the two should go
together (more general success, more peak success) but that doesn't
seem to be the case. The ideas of success may be too different?

That's referencing [Incentives Work: Getting Teachers to Come to School](https://economics.mit.edu/files/5582), which has this abstract:

> "We use a randomized experiment and a structural model to test
> whether monitoring and financial incentives can reduce teacher
> absence and increase learning in India. In treatment schools,
> teachers’ attendance was monitored daily using cameras, and their
> salaries were made a nonlinear function of attendance. Teacher
> absenteeism in the treatment group fell by 21 percentage points
> relative to the control group, and the children’s test scores
> increased by 0.17 standard deviations. We estimate a structural
> dynamic labor supply model and find that teachers respond strongly
> to financial incentives. Our model is used to compute
> cost-minimizing compensation policies."

That's referencing [Hit or Miss? The Effect of Assassinations on Institutions and War](https://economics.mit.edu/files/3055), which has this abstract:

> "Assassinations are a persistent feature of the political landscape.
> Using a new dataset of assassination attempts on all world leaders
> from 1875 to 2004, we exploit inherent randomness in the success or
> failure of assassination attempts to identify the effects of
> assassination. We find that, on average, successful assassinations
> of autocrats produce sustained moves toward democracy. We also find
> that assassinations affect the intensity of small-scale conflicts.
> The results document a contemporary source of institutional change,
> inform theories of conflict, and show that small sources of
> randomness can have a pronounced effect on history."

Kind of an interesting analysis for [the great man theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_man_theory)...

Some discussion around page 238 of the (non-)benefit of going to
Harvard etc... It's more useful to be the kind of person who _could_
go to Harvard (get in, etc.) - the perceived incremental benefit of
going to Harvard vs. some other school may not be real.

This is about people writing on microfinance sites. Sounds about
right; interesting to see quantitative support for this kind of thing.

> "social science is becoming a real science."

He says this is the "big point" of his book...

Strong praise for Jawbone on page 277, which turned out to be bad
timing as the company went under the year the book came out (2017)...

On page 283 there's a reference to Ellenberg's [Hawking Index][],
which was amusing to me because I've enjoyed following Ellenberg a
little bit since reading his [How Not to Be Wrong][].
