# That little voice in your head, by Gawdat

[Rob Archangel][] (of [Archangel Ink][]) sent me [Mo Gawdat][]'s
latest [book][] to review, so I skimmed it. Gawdat's son died at 21.
The book is a collection of [stoic][], Buddhist, and TED Talk
philosophy. You could do worse, though I do think Gawdat is [wrong][]
about AI and consciousness. That Little Voice is uncomfortably like
watching him struggle to mourn.

To its credit, the book includes summaries.


---

> Summary of Part One
>
> 4-3-2-1, those are the reasons our brains make us unhappy.
>
> **4** (wrong) **Inputs** distort our perception of the truth. Three
> come from within us. Those are conditioning, recycled thoughts and
> trapped emotions. But the biggest one is all-pervasive around us. It
> is the hidden triggers, from the news media to the entertainment
> industry, all the way to the advice of a friend that does not apply
> to your life context. Don’t let your thoughts be influenced by your
> inner inputs. See them for what they are and weed them out. Then,
> whatever you do, stop injecting your life with hidden triggers. You
> are what you think. Stop letting the thoughts of others make you who
> you are.
>
> **3** (exaggerated) **Defences** keep us safe but make us suffer.
> Our brains have built within them every defence mechanism that’s
> helped other species. A reptilian brain that lives for avoiding
> danger, a mammalian brain that exists to seek rewards and avoid
> pain, and a rational brain that is constantly planning and
> analysing. Those defences keep us stuck in Aversion, Attachment and
> an All-Pervasive Dissatisfaction. Learn to make your reptile feel
> safe, make your mammal enjoy what is and remind your rational human
> to see that all is OK.
>
> **2** (opposite) **Polarities** are part of every one of us. The
> feminine and the masculine. Those polarities are not determined by
> biology, gender or sexual preference. They are a way of life. One is
> about being and the other about doing. Our modern world, and each of
> us, are submerged in doing. We need more of our feminine qualities.
> We need to learn to be.
>
> **1** (harmful) **Thought** – the incessant type of thinking – is
> the result of letting our thoughts repeat, unchecked by our
> deliberate attention. Many clinical conditions that are associated
> with unhappiness are the result of scattered thoughts and
> mind-wandering. Learning to pay deliberate attention has always been
> my top advice for anyone who seeks to be happy. Be here. Repeat a
> bad habit often enough, and you become really good at it because,
> through neuroplasticity, Practice Makes Miserable. Stop practising
> your own unhappiness. Turn the process the opposite way. Learn to go
> to the happiness gym and work on the habits that reverse the 4-3-2-1
> model.
>
> Practise limiting your information diet only to what’s good for you.
> Remember to practise your gratitude muscle. Live more in the
> feminine and pay deliberate attention. One small step after another
> and your brain will be rewired for happiness to be its default
> state.

> Summary of Part Two
>
> The impact of a thought is surely not confined within our skull and
> surely not to the instant that thought took place. What you think
> changes you emotionally and physically, and then it changes your
> pattern of thinking itself as it plays endlessly on repeat.
>
> Our emotions, erratic as they sometimes may seem, are
> hyperpredictable. They are triggered by thoughts that follow
> repeatable patterns. The modern world teaches us to hide our
> emotions and this disconnects us from them, even to deny them.
> Leaving our emotions unexpressed turns us into zombies walking
> through life uninterested or pressure cookers waiting to explode.
>
> But we only feel alive when we feel, just like we only feel when we
> are alive. We need to get in touch with our emotions, acknowledge
> them – even celebrate them – sit with them, experience their storms
> and harness their energy to move us forward.
>
> Our autonomic nervous system responds to the world even before our
> thoughts catch up with what happened. Our sympathetic nervous system
> stresses us to protect us. It prepares us to face challenges and
> threats with superhuman powers. This feature in our design saved our
> species, but now, as our stress response lingers, it is leading us
> to unhappiness.
>
> We need to engage our parasympathetic nervous system to remind our
> bodies that things are OK. Learn to relax, be around those who do,
> and create a sense of safety by remembering our blessings and
> removing what stresses us from our lives.
>
> Finally, we need to stop the endless loops of incessant thinking.
> They take us down a spiral of unhappiness and leave no positive
> impact on the world whatsoever. To stop the thinking, treat your
> brain like a third party. I call mine Becky and I have a clear
> agreement with my brain. Bring me joyful thoughts or useful
> thoughts. Every other thought is a waste of my life. Sign the
> contract. Get your brain to comply.

> Summary of Part Three
>
> Many happiness teachings may seem to come across as an invitation to
> calm or control one’s brain. Because our stray incessant thoughts
> can cause a lot of unhappiness, it is obvious that keeping our minds
> in check is a sure path to a calmer, happier life. But it’s not the
> only path.
>
> If an active mind is engaged in useful thinking – generating
> thoughts that improve your life and state of wellbeing – then, by
> all means, think as much as you can.
>
> There are four types of useful thoughts. I strongly urge you to make
> those types of thoughts the norm of what your brain focuses on. That
> way it will no longer have the capacity to think the negative
> thoughts that waste your life and make you unhappy.
>
> 1) **Experiential Thinking** - Experiencing the world exactly as it
> is requires your brain to engage just as much as it needs to when
> processing any other kind of thought. As a matter of fact, because
> your brain is only able to do one thing at a time, observing the
> world with mindfulness is a bulletproof way to live in reality and
> not inside your own head. Meditation is a valuable practice that
> can, over time, reconfigure your brain to become more capable of
> living in the present moment instead of lost in its own thoughts.
>
> Meditation is just a practice, though. To truly transform those
> skills into the reality of your everyday life, use newer versions of
> it that are fit for the modern world to learn to be present every
> minute of every day.
>
> 2) **Problem-Solving** – is the most highly praised type of thinking
> in our analytical modern world. The capacity to overcome challenges
> by finding solutions is mostly applied in our work and professional
> life. Yet, it can equally be applied to lead to our happiness and
> wellbeing.
>
> The **happiness flowchart** is a good example of how you can use
> your disciplined problem-solving brain to ensure you bounce back to
> happiness swiftly when an event disturbs your mood. Once you’ve
> learned to recognize, acknowledge, even embrace, an emotion, find
> the thought that triggered it and then ask yourself three questions:
>
> a. **Is it true?** Is there evidence to support the validity of the
> thought triggering my happiness. If the thought is fiction created
> by your brain, drop it. If it is true, then ask the next question...
>
> b. **Can I do something about it?** Unhappiness, you see, is just a
> survival mechanism. It’s your brain’s invitation for you to do
> something about what it sees as a suboptimal condition for your
> survival and success. If there is something you can do about what’s
> making you unhappy, do it. The unhappiness will go away and your
> world will become better. If there is nothing you can do, then ask
> the last question ...
>
> c. **Can I accept and commit?** Life, every now and again, is bound
> to send a predicament your way. An event that doesn’t meet your
> hopes of how life should be which is beyond your ability to fix or
> improve. When there is nothing you can do about your situation,
> learn to accept it for what it is, then commit to do whatever you
> can do to make your life better despite, or even because of, the
> challenge that you are facing.
>
> 3) **Flow** – When we flow, we merge our being with our doing. We
> get absorbed into what we do fully, we do it better and we feel
> lighter. To flow, make the task at hand a tiny bit harder than your
> current skill, clear away the distractions and break it into smaller
> tasks and focus on the small bits instead of the final results, do
> each bit to the best of your abilities and forget about time. Give
> every task all the time it needs.
>
> 4) **Give** – It is the smartest thing you can ever do. Nothing will
> ever make you happier or make our world better.
>
> Our brains are nothing but sophisticated computer systems. They are
> highly predictable in their operations. You don’t necessarily need a
> silent brain to be happy. All you need is a positive, useful brain.
> Your brain will do what you tell it to do. It’s time to start your
> training.
