<h1>That little voice in your head, by Gawdat</h1>
<p class="date">Monday July  4, 2022</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rob-archangel-50bb35176/" title="Rob Archangel">Rob Archangel</a> (of <a href="https://www.archangelink.com/" title="Your partner in leveraging your credibility and expertise into self-publishing success">Archangel Ink</a>) sent me <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mo_Gawdat" title="Mo Gawdat">Mo Gawdat</a>'s
latest <a href="https://www.mogawdat.com/littlevoice" title="That little voice in your head">book</a> to review, so I skimmed it. Gawdat's son died at 21.
The book is a collection of <a href="/20210107-enchiridion_in_52_sentences/" title="The Enchiridion in 52 sentences">stoic</a>, Buddhist, and TED Talk
philosophy. You could do worse, though I do think Gawdat is <a href="https://www.mogawdat.com/scarysmart" title="Scary Smart The Future of Artificial Intelligence and How You Can Save Our World">wrong</a>
about AI and consciousness. That Little Voice is uncomfortably like
watching him struggle to mourn.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Summary of Part One</p>
<p>4-3-2-1, those are the reasons our brains make us unhappy.</p>
<p><strong>4</strong> (wrong) <strong>Inputs</strong> distort our perception of the truth. Three
come from within us. Those are conditioning, recycled thoughts and
trapped emotions. But the biggest one is all-pervasive around us. It
is the hidden triggers, from the news media to the entertainment
industry, all the way to the advice of a friend that does not apply
to your life context. Don’t let your thoughts be influenced by your
inner inputs. See them for what they are and weed them out. Then,
whatever you do, stop injecting your life with hidden triggers. You
are what you think. Stop letting the thoughts of others make you who
you are.</p>
<p><strong>3</strong> (exaggerated) <strong>Defences</strong> keep us safe but make us suffer.
Our brains have built within them every defence mechanism that’s
helped other species. A reptilian brain that lives for avoiding
danger, a mammalian brain that exists to seek rewards and avoid
pain, and a rational brain that is constantly planning and
analysing. Those defences keep us stuck in Aversion, Attachment and
an All-Pervasive Dissatisfaction. Learn to make your reptile feel
safe, make your mammal enjoy what is and remind your rational human
to see that all is OK.</p>
<p><strong>2</strong> (opposite) <strong>Polarities</strong> are part of every one of us. The
feminine and the masculine. Those polarities are not determined by
biology, gender or sexual preference. They are a way of life. One is
about being and the other about doing. Our modern world, and each of
us, are submerged in doing. We need more of our feminine qualities.
We need to learn to be.</p>
<p><strong>1</strong> (harmful) <strong>Thought</strong> – the incessant type of thinking – is
the result of letting our thoughts repeat, unchecked by our
deliberate attention. Many clinical conditions that are associated
with unhappiness are the result of scattered thoughts and
mind-wandering. Learning to pay deliberate attention has always been
my top advice for anyone who seeks to be happy. Be here. Repeat a
bad habit often enough, and you become really good at it because,
through neuroplasticity, Practice Makes Miserable. Stop practising
your own unhappiness. Turn the process the opposite way. Learn to go
to the happiness gym and work on the habits that reverse the 4-3-2-1
model.</p>
<p>Practise limiting your information diet only to what’s good for you.
Remember to practise your gratitude muscle. Live more in the
feminine and pay deliberate attention. One small step after another
and your brain will be rewired for happiness to be its default
state.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Summary of Part Two</p>
<p>The impact of a thought is surely not confined within our skull and
surely not to the instant that thought took place. What you think
changes you emotionally and physically, and then it changes your
pattern of thinking itself as it plays endlessly on repeat.</p>
<p>Our emotions, erratic as they sometimes may seem, are
hyperpredictable. They are triggered by thoughts that follow
repeatable patterns. The modern world teaches us to hide our
emotions and this disconnects us from them, even to deny them.
Leaving our emotions unexpressed turns us into zombies walking
through life uninterested or pressure cookers waiting to explode.</p>
<p>But we only feel alive when we feel, just like we only feel when we
are alive. We need to get in touch with our emotions, acknowledge
them – even celebrate them – sit with them, experience their storms
and harness their energy to move us forward.</p>
<p>Our autonomic nervous system responds to the world even before our
thoughts catch up with what happened. Our sympathetic nervous system
stresses us to protect us. It prepares us to face challenges and
threats with superhuman powers. This feature in our design saved our
species, but now, as our stress response lingers, it is leading us
to unhappiness.</p>
<p>We need to engage our parasympathetic nervous system to remind our
bodies that things are OK. Learn to relax, be around those who do,
and create a sense of safety by remembering our blessings and
removing what stresses us from our lives.</p>
<p>Finally, we need to stop the endless loops of incessant thinking.
They take us down a spiral of unhappiness and leave no positive
impact on the world whatsoever. To stop the thinking, treat your
brain like a third party. I call mine Becky and I have a clear
agreement with my brain. Bring me joyful thoughts or useful
thoughts. Every other thought is a waste of my life. Sign the
contract. Get your brain to comply.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Summary of Part Three</p>
<p>Many happiness teachings may seem to come across as an invitation to
calm or control one’s brain. Because our stray incessant thoughts
can cause a lot of unhappiness, it is obvious that keeping our minds
in check is a sure path to a calmer, happier life. But it’s not the
only path.</p>
<p>If an active mind is engaged in useful thinking – generating
thoughts that improve your life and state of wellbeing – then, by
all means, think as much as you can.</p>
<p>There are four types of useful thoughts. I strongly urge you to make
those types of thoughts the norm of what your brain focuses on. That
way it will no longer have the capacity to think the negative
thoughts that waste your life and make you unhappy.</p>
<p>1) <strong>Experiential Thinking</strong> - Experiencing the world exactly as it
is requires your brain to engage just as much as it needs to when
processing any other kind of thought. As a matter of fact, because
your brain is only able to do one thing at a time, observing the
world with mindfulness is a bulletproof way to live in reality and
not inside your own head. Meditation is a valuable practice that
can, over time, reconfigure your brain to become more capable of
living in the present moment instead of lost in its own thoughts.</p>
<p>Meditation is just a practice, though. To truly transform those
skills into the reality of your everyday life, use newer versions of
it that are fit for the modern world to learn to be present every
minute of every day.</p>
<p>2) <strong>Problem-Solving</strong> – is the most highly praised type of thinking
in our analytical modern world. The capacity to overcome challenges
by finding solutions is mostly applied in our work and professional
life. Yet, it can equally be applied to lead to our happiness and
wellbeing.</p>
<p>The <strong>happiness flowchart</strong> is a good example of how you can use
your disciplined problem-solving brain to ensure you bounce back to
happiness swiftly when an event disturbs your mood. Once you’ve
learned to recognize, acknowledge, even embrace, an emotion, find
the thought that triggered it and then ask yourself three questions:</p>
<p>a. <strong>Is it true?</strong> Is there evidence to support the validity of the
thought triggering my happiness. If the thought is fiction created
by your brain, drop it. If it is true, then ask the next question...</p>
<p>b. <strong>Can I do something about it?</strong> Unhappiness, you see, is just a
survival mechanism. It’s your brain’s invitation for you to do
something about what it sees as a suboptimal condition for your
survival and success. If there is something you can do about what’s
making you unhappy, do it. The unhappiness will go away and your
world will become better. If there is nothing you can do, then ask
the last question ...</p>
<p>c. <strong>Can I accept and commit?</strong> Life, every now and again, is bound
to send a predicament your way. An event that doesn’t meet your
hopes of how life should be which is beyond your ability to fix or
improve. When there is nothing you can do about your situation,
learn to accept it for what it is, then commit to do whatever you
can do to make your life better despite, or even because of, the
challenge that you are facing.</p>
<p>3) <strong>Flow</strong> – When we flow, we merge our being with our doing. We
get absorbed into what we do fully, we do it better and we feel
lighter. To flow, make the task at hand a tiny bit harder than your
current skill, clear away the distractions and break it into smaller
tasks and focus on the small bits instead of the final results, do
each bit to the best of your abilities and forget about time. Give
every task all the time it needs.</p>
<p>4) <strong>Give</strong> – It is the smartest thing you can ever do. Nothing will
ever make you happier or make our world better.</p>
<p>Our brains are nothing but sophisticated computer systems. They are
highly predictable in their operations. You don’t necessarily need a
silent brain to be happy. All you need is a positive, useful brain.
Your brain will do what you tell it to do. It’s time to start your
training.</p>
