<h1>Pragmatic Thinking and Learning, by Andy Hunt</h1>
<p class="date">Saturday January 16, 2021</p>
<p>This 2008 <a href="https://pragprog.com/titles/ahptl/pragmatic-thinking-and-learning/">book</a> contained things both familiar and novel to me,
with a focus on creativity. One thing it describes is the
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Weinberg-Writing-Fieldstone-Gerald-M/dp/093263365X">fieldstone method</a>, which I think is close to my recent style of
collecting ideas. I'm trying the <a href="https://juliacameronlive.com/basic-tools/morning-pages/">morning pages</a> technique the book
also describes, and I think the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Gallwey#Inner_game">inner game</a> idea of teaching
awareness could be good. The book is an artifact of Hunt's experience,
drawing together and organizing ideas he'd encountered. Good stuff!</p>

<h3>Chapter 1: <a href="#intro" name="intro">Introduction</a></h3>
<hr />
<p>On page 2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Because of this complex interaction of many interested parties and
forces and the constant evolution of change, it seems to me that the
two most important modern skills are these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Communication skills</li>
<li>Learning and thinking skills"</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"The learning is always up to you." (page 3)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h3>Chapter 2: <a href="#journey" name="journey">Journey from novice to expert</a></h3>
<hr />
<p>Event theories vs. construct theories is kind of an interesting
division... See e.g. <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF03395570">Events and Constructs</a>. (Seems like
psychologists think about this distinction.)</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"... consider the case of the developer who claims ten years of
experience, but in reality it was one year of experience repeated
nine times. That doesn't count as <em>experience</em>." (page 15)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"The expert is very good at targeted, focused pattern matching."
(page 21)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's interesting how the focus on experts using intuition makes it
seem like experts are less "interpretable" than non-experts, in the
same way that neural networks are less interpretable than simpler
models.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"... the reality that there is anywhere from a 20:1 and 40:1
difference in productivity among developers, depending on whose
study you believe" (page 23, with footnote as follows) "In 1968, a
difference of 10:1 in productivity among programmers was noted in
<em>Exploratory experimental studies comparing online and offline
programming performance</em>. The gulf seems to have widened since
then."</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Sadly, studies seem to indicate that most people, for most skills,
for most of their lives, never get any higher than the second stage
[of five], advanced beginner, "performing the tasks they need and
learning new tasks as the need arises but never acquiring a more
broad-based, conceptual understanding of the task environment.""
(page 25)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Beware decontextualized objectivity." (page 36)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h3>Chapter 3: <a href="#brain" name="brain">This is your brain</a></h3>
<hr />
<p>Interesting box on page 42 about PKMzeta in the brain being important
for memory (<a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/313/5790/1141.abstract" title="Storage of Spatial Information by the Maintenance Mechanism of LTP">ref</a>).</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Everyone–no matter their education, economic status, day job, or
age–has good ideas. But of this large number of people with good
ideas, far fewer bother to keep track of them. Of those, even fewer
bother to act on those ideas. Fewer still then have the resources to
make a good idea a success." (page 46)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>"Linear" L-mode and "Rich" R-mode as alternatives to "left brain" and
"right brain." He also calls it CPU #1 and CPU #2.</p>
<p>He references Guy Claxton's "Hare Brain, Tortoise Mind" which uses
"deliberate" d-mode and "undermind," Dan Pink's l-directed and
r-directed, and Betty Edwards' L mode and R mode. (page 50)</p>
<hr />
<h3>Chapter 4: <a href="#right" name="right">Get in your right mind</a></h3>
<hr />
<p>Emphasis on multi-sensory (even seemingly pointless multi-sensory,
like fiddling with a paperclip).</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>""Drawing" is really about seeing."</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Write Drunk, Revise Sober"</p>

<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Metaphor, a common ground for both verbalizations and images, is a
way to voyage back and forth between the subconscious and conscious,
between right and left hemispheres." (from Conscious/Unconscious
Interaction in a creative act, Gordon and Poze)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>Metaphor</em> comes from the Greek meaning "to transfer," with the
idea that you are transferring the properties of one object to
another in a way that is not literally possible." (page 75)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Ways to try to get ideas (etc.) from your subconscious:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Image streaming" (close your eyes and describe out loud what you
   see)</li>
<li>Free-form journaling (blogging, letter-writing, etc.)</li>
<li>"Morning pages" (write three pages first thing in the morning)</li>
<li>Just write (mentions Weinberg's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Weinberg-Writing-Fieldstone-Gerald-M/dp/093263365X">fieldstone method</a>, which is
   close to what I try to do, I think)</li>
<li>Walking</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Instead, you want to cultivate a style of non-goal-directed
thinking."</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Once you get used to seeing very small methods, with only a few
lines of code, very long methods jump out at you as <em>wrong</em>."</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"The only difference between a rut and a grave is the dimensions."</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"When faced with a thorny problem, Dave Thomas will often say, "Turn
that on its head." That's one <em>mental wack</em>: a way to knock you out
of your rut to make you look at a problem from a different point of
view.</p>
<p>"For instance, audio engineers use a well-known technique when
mixing a recording. To make the sound as good as possible, they
first go through and make each instrument sound <em>as bad</em> as
possible."</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"The [mental] locks include assuming there's only one right answer,
thinking that a given solution is not logical, or dismissing <em>play</em>
as frivolous."</p>

<p>Stuff on "generational affinity"</p>
<ul>
<li>GI generation, 1901-1924</li>
<li>Silent generation, 1925-1942</li>
<li>Boom generation, 1943-1960</li>

<li>Millenial generation, 1982-2005</li>
<li>Homeland generation, 2005-???</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Ideas about four repeating generation "archetypes" (hero, artist,
prophet, nomad) from Howe and Strauss, in e.g. the 2007
<a href="https://hbr.org/2007/07/the-next-20-years-how-customer-and-workforce-attitudes-will-evolve">The Next 20 Years: How Customer and Workforce Attitudes Will Evolve</a>,
which says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Three of those generations will still be vital forces in American
society 20 years from now: Boomers, Generation X, and Millennials.
Their attitudes and behaviors will have profound effects on the
economy, the workplace, and social institutions in general. For
example, as aging Boomers eschew high-tech medicine in favor of
holistic self-care, natural foods, and mind-body healing techniques,
some hospitals are opening new wings featuring alternative medicine
and spiritual counseling. Gen Xers, having grown up in an era of
failing schools and marriages, will remain alienated, disaffected,
and pragmatic as they enter midlife. Already the greatest
entrepreneurial generation in U.S. history, they will be highly
effective at pushing innovation, efficiency, and mass customization.
In contrast, young adult Millennials will favor teamwork, close
family relationships, job security, and a bland popular culture.
Their unprecedented digital empowerment and talent for organizing
will create a political powerhouse and may even revitalize the union
movement."</p>

<h3>Chapter 6: <a href="#learn" name="learn">Learn deliberately</a></h3>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheep_dip">Sheep dip</a> training doesn't work." (page 127)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"In addition, and perhaps surprisingly, simply mastering a syllabus
of knowledge doesn't increase professional effectiveness. ...
Mastery of the knowledge alone isn't sufficient." (page 128)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Recommends SMART goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Specific</li>
<li>Measurable</li>
<li>Achievable</li>
<li>Relevant</li>
<li>Time-boxed</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Create a Pragmatic Investment Plan" (page 133)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(This refers to investing in <em>learning</em>.)</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Unfortunately, relegating learning activities to your "free time"
is a recipe for failure." (page 133)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>On page 139 Hunt talks about Sternberg's
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triarchic_theory_of_intelligence">Triarchic theory of intelligence</a>, but his description is different
from what Wikipedia says... Wikipedia says it's these three:</p>
<ul>
<li>Componential – analytical</li>
<li>Experiential – creative</li>
<li>Practical - contextual</li>
</ul>
<p>But Hunt says "Sternberg sees a three-part mind, composed of a
meta-level component that manages thought processes overall;
performance-based components that do tasks, make associations, and so
on; and, finally, knowledge-acquisition components that handle
assimilating new information."</p>
<p>Maybe these line up somehow, but I don't see it from here.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Reading groups are nontoxic." (page 141)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Strong praise!</p>
<hr />
<p>Describes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQ3R">SQ3R</a> (Survey, Question, Read, Recite, Review).</p>
<hr />
<p>On page 146, the "Test-Driven Learning" box (a play on Test-Driven
Development) talks about spaced repetition. It mentions <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperMemo">SuperMemo</a>
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemosyne_(software)">Mnemosyne</a>, and references
<a href="https://web.mit.edu/jbelcher/www/learner/retrieval.pdf">The Critical Importance of Retrieval for Learning</a>, which is a
pretty great ref.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"As you go to add a new piece of information, a new thought, or an
insight to the mind map, you are faced with the question, where does
this belong? You have to evaluate the <em>relationships</em> between ideas,
not just the ideas themselves, and that can be a very revealing
activity." (page 149)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"The most value, I find, is to take the raw notes while listening
(which helps you stay focused as you extract salient points from the
lecture) and then transcribe these raw notes into "official notes."
Even if I never read these notes again, the act of transcribing the
raw notes is the most valuable portion of this exercise. You can do
the same thing with mind maps-start with a rough messy one, and
redraw it as needed. The redrawing helps form more associations in
your brain." (page 150)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is very much like <a href="/20201124-take_notes_like_paul_halmos/">the method of Paul Halmos</a>.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Use a mind map to help clarify." (page 152)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Page 154 has an interesting reference to <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Damon_Navandi/publication/268871823_Prepared_Mind_insight/links/547a09dd0cf205d1687fab98/Prepared-Mind-insight.pdf">The Prepared Mind</a>: Neural
Activity Prior to Problem Presentation Predicts Subsequent Solution by
Sudden Insight:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A recent study suggests that mental preparation <em>that involves an
inward focus of attention</em> can promote flashes of insight, even if
the preparation occurs well in advance of facing any particular
problem."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This reference isn't really applicable to the book's topic there
(documentation). It isn't super clear how to get the mental focus the
researchers identify, or whether we really care because it seems like
it didn't help people solve more problems, but only to be more likely
to report that they solved via a flash of insight. And the problems in
question are like "pine, crab, sauce" ("apple") so it isn't clear how
useful this is anyway.</p>
<p>I think Hunt is right that "it might be that <em>documenting</em> is more
important than <em>documentation</em>" but his reference doesn't support that
claim.</p>

<h3>Chapter 7: <a href="#gain" name="gain">Gain experience</a></h3>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"we build to learn, not learn to build." (page 160)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"You need to unlearn just as much as you need to learn." (page 164)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This reminds me of what Dijkstra said in
<a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD10xx/EWD1036.html">On the cruelty of really teaching computing science</a>.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>""I don't know" is a fine answer, but don't let it end there." (page
165)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Hunt riffs on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Gallwey#Inner_game">inner game</a> to talk about increasing your
awareness to increase your feedback and improve your improvement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"the idea is to teach the student awareness and to use that
awareness to correct their performance." (page 170)</p>
<p>"This is a key aspect to playing the inner game: don't focus on
correcting individual details, but just be aware. Accept <em>what is</em>
as a first step, and just be aware of it. Don't judge, don't rush in
with a solution, don't criticize." (page 170)</p>
<p>"Don't just do something; stand there." (page 171)</p>
<p>"The Inner Game series sums up this idea with the phrase, "Trying
fails, awareness cures.""</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Page 173 references <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/51559/6-myths-creativity">The 6 Myths Of Creativity</a>, which are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Creativity comes from creative types</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Reference here to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Intelligence">On Intelligence</a> by Jeff Hawkins.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Legendary jazz guitarist Pat Metheny takes this idea
[of surrounding yourself with inspiration] one step further and
offers this advice: "Always be the worst guy in every band you're
in. If you're the best guy there, you need to be in a different
band. And I think that works for almost everything that's out there
as well."" (page 177)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h3>Chapter 8: <a href="#focus" name="focus">Manage focus</a></h3>
<hr />
<p>Hunt recommends <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vipassan%C4%81">meditation</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p>In "Defocus to Focus" (page 187) on thinking about problems
creatively:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"it's not the idea of not doing <em>anything</em>, it's the idea of not
doing <em>something</em>."</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Hunt advances Dennett's ideas from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness_Explained">Consciousness Explained</a>, saying
"Multiple drafts form consciousness."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"That makes consciousness a bottom-up, self-organizing, perhaps even
emergent property." (page 189)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Have you heard of the consultant's Rule of Three? In general, if
you can't think of three ways a plan can go wrong or think of three
different solutions to a problem, then you haven't thought it
through enough." (page 189)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A footnote attributes this to Jerry Weinberg's <em>The Secrets of
Consulting</em>.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Thomas Jeffereson owned somewhere in the neighborhood of 10,000
books in his lifetime. And donated nearly 7,000 of them to form the
core of the Library of Congress in 1815. (page 191)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Hunt advocates using a personal wiki.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The real beauty of this approach is that once you have a place to
put a specific bit of information, you'll notice that new, relevant
bits of data suddenly start to show up out of nowhere. It's a
similar phenomenon to <em>sense tuning</em>."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He doesn't quite manage to say Baader-Meinhof.</p>
<p>The idea also aligns with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Weinberg-Writing-Fieldstone-Gerald-M/dp/093263365X">fieldstone method</a>, I think.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Multitasking takes a heavy toll on productivity. One study found
that in general, multitasking can cost you 20 to 40 percent of your
productivity."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The "study" is footnoted as
http://www.umich.edu/~bcalab/multitasking.html, which is a collection
of links to papers... Not sure what it's referencing in particular.</p>
<hr />
<p>He recommends using one of those focus apps that blocks out the
internet etc. He references "Think!" and DeskTopple. Current options
seem to be <a href="https://zapier.com/blog/stay-focused-avoid-distractions/">different</a>.</p>
