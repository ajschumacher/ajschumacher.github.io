<h1>(Audio) Build, by Fadell</h1>
<p class="date">Friday May 17, 2024</p>
<p>The "advice encyclopedia" from the father of the iPod is <a href="https://www.buildc.com/the-book" title="Build, the Book">billed</a> as
"an unorthodox guide" and maybe it is, depending on your orthodoxy.
Here are some of its recommendations as I recall them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Work really hard.</li>
<li>Be a perfectionist.</li>
<li>Micro-manage. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Fadell" title="Tony Fadell">Tony</a> tries to clarify that what he recommends
   isn't micro-managing; the distinction is something like managing
   outputs as good vs. process as bad.)</li>
<li>Push people hard.</li>
<li>Have interviews done by a small group of people who will work with
   the new person, not a bunch of people from all over the company.</li>
<li>Don't have a lot of perks at the office.</li>
<li>Blame Google for Nest not going how you wanted.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think the most interesting thing, to me, is the tension between
intrinsic motivation vs. external pushing for generating results. Tony
seems like a pusher, and he's gotten results. But do bosses have to be
so hard-driving?</p>
<p>Fadell comments on how much time he spent on "people problems" (HR or
personnel issues) as a leader. This might always be the case, but I
also wonder whether particular leadership styles (and related hiring
choices) lead to more of this. Fadell says he followed a "no assholes
rule" in hiring. Might anosognosia be at play?</p>
<p>I'm not sure I'd like to work with Fadell, but I tend to like his
goals and his <a href="https://www.buildc.com/" title="Build Collective">Build Collective</a> seems to be supporting cool things.
(Ends vs. means?) The book is almost a promotional tie-in for this
venture operation.</p>
