# (Audio) Playing with Reality, by Clancy

I think [Darian Woods][] mentioned [Clancy][]'s book in an episode of
The Indicator. Great recommendation! _Playing with Reality_ could be
the best book of the year. Beautifully written, rich with information,
humane in perspective. The thesis is basically that the map is not the
territory, and games can be kinds of maps. Sort of like
[The Tyranny of Metrics][], it explores ways that simplified and
quantified models can mislead. Fascinating throughout.

### History of education

The first game in the book is [Rithmomachia][], the math game you
played as part of your [Quadrivium][] education, which was a thing
from Greek to Medieval times. The history of education is fascinating.

[Rithmomachia]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rithmomachia


 * [Trivium][]
     * grammar
     * logic
     * rhetoric
 * [Quadrivium][]
     * “arithmetic (pure numbers)”
     * “geometry (numbers in space)”
     * “music (numbers in time)”
     * “astronomy (numbers in space and time)” (page 5)

> “Some medieval historians blame the quadrivial curriculum for
> holding European scholarship back hundreds of years. Its focus on
> harmony blinkered scientists to fundamental advances, such as the
> discovery of irrational numbers and celestial mechanics. The
> quadrivial curriculum was largely abandoned by the seventeenth
> century, as new mathematical techniques from Persia and India led to
> breakthroughs in calculus and probability theory. Rithmomachia
> similarly fell by the wayside.” (page 7)

This idea, of education hampering progress, is very interesting. I
wonder whether things like the Chinese exam system might have had a
similar effect. What about the current education system? What is
blocking rather than enabling progress?


The book doesn't talk about it, but according to Wikipedia an
intermediate successor curriculum was the [studia humanitatis][]
around the 14th century, with Petrarch.

 * [studia humanitatis][]
     * grammar
     * rhetoric
     * poetry
     * history
     * moral philosophy

Later, the book describes "required training for nobility in Europe
and the Near East."

 * an eighteenth century aristocrat was expected to master
     * calligraphy
     * horseback riding
     * history
     * philosophy
     * weaponry
     * music
     * astrology
     * games, especially chess


> “Kriegsspiel roots back to the late eighteenth century, when
> mathematician Johann Hellwig invented a variant of chess. Chess was
> then considered to be required training for nobility in Europe and
> the Near East; an aristocrat was expected to master calligraphy,
> horseback riding, history, philosophy, weaponry, music, astrology,
> and games, especially chess. Tutors used chess to teach strategic
> thinking and mathematics to their pupils. Chess, originally
> chaturanga, originated in India as an explicit abstraction of war.”

Lots of the book is about how we learn from games, but in explicitly
educational contexts and elsewhere.

### Psychohistory

“Social physics” is yet another name for [psychohistory][]!

And again!

I think Skinner is getting at the questions of consciousness and free
will. Provocative phrasing.

Sometimes data science work feels a little like this. People want
predictions, and they don't always want a careful accounting of
uncertainty. They want to hear what they want to hear. And like magic
or divination, why not just take a stab at it? You'll be right
sometimes!

This idea is applied to Black–Scholes, and Taleb's “ludic fallacy” is
described: the mistake of applying the rules of games to real-life
situations.

The example is weird MacAskill argument. These "Effective Altruism"
people, jeez.

This presentation of von Neumann as a 10x genius is interesting.

The part I'm interested in here is that Fisher is said to have a
"characteristically cryptic style." This is the guy who wrote
"Statistical Methods for Research Workers" and "The Design of
Experiments." Is his cryptic style part of why frequentist statistics
is such a poorly understood mess?

This is pretty neat. Start with the end in mind, and then rather than
thinking we can influence people directly, imagine we can control "the
rules of the game" (through policy, etc.) - how do they get set up to
achieve the desired end? Possible connection also to "nudge" ideas,
etc.
