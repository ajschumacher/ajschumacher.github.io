<h1>(Audio) Playing with Reality, by Clancy</h1>
<p class="date">Thursday December 26, 2024</p>
<p>I think <a href="https://www.npr.org/people/724387257/darian-woods">Darian Woods</a> mentioned <a href="https://www.kellybclancy.com/">Clancy</a>'s book in an episode of
The Indicator. Great recommendation! <em>Playing with Reality</em> could be
the best book of the year. Beautifully written, rich with information,
humane in perspective. The thesis is basically that the map is not the
territory, and games can be kinds of maps. Sort of like
<a href="/20200425-tyranny_of_metrics_by_muller/">The Tyranny of Metrics</a>, it explores ways that simplified and
quantified models can mislead. Fascinating throughout.</p>

<h3>History of education</h3>
<p>The first game in the book is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rithmomachia">Rithmomachia</a>, the math game you
played as part of your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrivium">Quadrivium</a> education, which was a thing
from Greek to Medieval times. The history of education is fascinating.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivium">Trivium</a><ul>
<li>grammar</li>
<li>logic</li>
<li>rhetoric</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrivium">Quadrivium</a><ul>
<li>“arithmetic (pure numbers)”</li>
<li>“geometry (numbers in space)”</li>
<li>“music (numbers in time)”</li>
<li>“astronomy (numbers in space and time)” (page 5)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“Some medieval historians blame the quadrivial curriculum for
holding European scholarship back hundreds of years. Its focus on
harmony blinkered scientists to fundamental advances, such as the
discovery of irrational numbers and celestial mechanics. The
quadrivial curriculum was largely abandoned by the seventeenth
century, as new mathematical techniques from Persia and India led to
breakthroughs in calculus and probability theory. Rithmomachia
similarly fell by the wayside.” (page 7)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This idea, of education hampering progress, is very interesting. I
wonder whether things like the Chinese exam system might have had a
similar effect. What about the current education system? What is
blocking rather than enabling progress?</p>
<p>The book doesn't talk about it, but according to Wikipedia an
intermediate successor curriculum was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitas#Revival">studia humanitatis</a>
around the 14th century, with Petrarch.</p>
<ul>

<li>history</li>
<li>moral philosophy</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p>Later, the book describes "required training for nobility in Europe
and the Near East."</p>
<ul>
<li>an eighteenth century aristocrat was expected to master<ul>
<li>calligraphy</li>
<li>horseback riding</li>
<li>history</li>
<li>philosophy</li>
<li>weaponry</li>
<li>music</li>
<li>astrology</li>
<li>games, especially chess</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“Kriegsspiel roots back to the late eighteenth century, when
mathematician Johann Hellwig invented a variant of chess. Chess was
then considered to be required training for nobility in Europe and
the Near East; an aristocrat was expected to master calligraphy,
horseback riding, history, philosophy, weaponry, music, astrology,
and games, especially chess. Tutors used chess to teach strategic
thinking and mathematics to their pupils. Chess, originally
chaturanga, originated in India as an explicit abstraction of war.”
(page 47)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lots of the book is about how we learn from games, but in explicitly
educational contexts and elsewhere.</p>

<h3>Psychohistory</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“The new field’s [statistics'] success expanded to other social
sciences. The nineteenth-century Belgian mathematician Adolphe
Quetelet was a tireless advocate for a new science he called “social
physics,” whereby he hoped to work out a human correlate of
celestial mechanics and describe the trajectories of civilization.
Quetelet used massive datasets to detect underlying patterns. He
found regularities in births, deaths, suicides, and even crime
rates. He argued that crimes should not be considered acts of
individual volition. Instead, he found that they obeyed statistical
laws at the population level. “Society itself contains the germs of
all the crimes committed. It is the social state, in some measure,
that prepares these crimes, and the criminal is merely the
instrument that executes them.” Criminals were themselves victims,
helpless to the laws of social physics acting on society, a
necessary sacrifice to preserve civilization. He suggested that
evidence-based legislation—aimed more at ameliorating the
institutional causes of crime and less at punishing individual
criminals themselves—was the best hope for reforming society.
Quetelet’s ideas were so pervasive that physicist James Clerk
Maxwell often illustrated his work in statistical mechanics using
analogies drawn from social physics. To those armed with the hammer
of probability theory, the world looked like a statistics problem.
If we could use math to understand even chance, why not use it to
understand humanity itself?” (page 40)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Social physics” is yet another name for <a href="/20200714-foundation_trilogy/">psychohistory</a>!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The historian Hans Delbrück recognized that military and political
history are inextricably tangled. He was committed to establishing a
quantitative study of history. Throughout his career, Delbrück pored
over historical data, hoping to develop a science of war,
relentlessly workshopping historical battles to test his theories.
He argued that Germany’s failures in World War I were primarily
strategic in nature. He advocated for their neutered military to
take up historical study and simulations. By embracing these
simulations during the interwar period, the Germans developed a new
form of combat using theoretical forces that did not yet exist but
soon would. It promised to solve the stagnant trench warfare that
had characterized World War I, leveraging surprise to dominate and
demoralize the enemy. In World War II, this tactic would rain terror
from the skies across Europe. It would come to be known throughout
the world as the Blitzkrieg.” (page 52)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And again!</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>“The real question,” he [Skinner] writes, “is not whether machines
think but whether men do. The mystery which surrounds a thinking
machine already surrounds a thinking man.” (page 21)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think Skinner is getting at the questions of consciousness and free
will. Provocative phrasing.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>“Like many scientists of the era, such as Galileo, Cardano was made
a celebrity by the horoscopes he drew up for the ruling class.
Astrology played the role of today’s science-funding agencies.”
(page 34)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes data science work feels a little like this. People want
predictions, and they don't always want a careful accounting of
uncertainty. They want to hear what they want to hear. And like magic
or divination, why not just take a stab at it? You'll be right
sometimes!</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>“It seemed so ubiquitous that many scientists used it to simplify
the measurement of errors in a wide range of datasets, including
many they shouldn’t have. They were, as mathematician Nassim
Nicholas Taleb puts it, “blinded by bell curves.” (page 40)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This idea is applied to Black–Scholes, and Taleb's “ludic fallacy” is
described: the mistake of applying the rules of games to real-life
situations.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>“Through seemingly objective arguments like these, the status quo
keeps its finger tipping the scales in the marketplace of ideas,
assigning invented values to justify arbitrary ideologies.” (page
45)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The example is weird MacAskill argument. These "Effective Altruism"
people, jeez.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>“His [Hilbert's] student Hermann Weyl writes: “Mathematics is no
longer knowledge but a game of formulae, ruled by certain
conventions, which is very well comparable to the game of chess.”
(page 58)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>“We may still choose to make a wager with a low likelihood of
success if the outcome is something we want enough—like putting in
the effort to apply for a highly competitive job, even if it’s
unlikely we’ll get it. In this framework, a rational actor will
always make choices that they believe will maximize their expected
utility, balancing their desire for a given option with its risks.
Given certain assumptions, their preferences can be described by a
utility function, which can be used to predict their strategies and
choices. Von Neumann’s elegant formulation transmuted subjective
individual desire into a shared frame of reference, defined entirely
by an agent’s actions in a collective playing field. He derived all
of this in the span of a single afternoon. Morgenstern later wrote
in his diary that watching von Neumann solve in one day a problem
that had plagued economists for years “gave me great satisfaction,
and moved me so much that afterwards I could not think about
anything else.” (page 66)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This presentation of von Neumann as a 10x genius is interesting.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>“In game theory, players’ preferences are usually assumed to be
fixed. But psychologists have found that people’s choices are
sensitive to a game’s context. Players behave differently in a
prisoner’s dilemma depending on how it’s presented to them. If it’s
called the Wall Street Game, players are more likely to defect. If
it’s called the Community Game, they’re more likely to cooperate.
The two games have the exact same structure, payoffs, and penalties
(e.g., jail time), yet their titles alone cause players to act
differently.” (page 76)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>“Game theory, pioneered by a traumatized man hoping to plumb the
depths of human nature, has only ever been about math: the dynamics
of a maximizing function, not of real people. We must be careful not
to let its models mean anything about ourselves, and careful to
prevent its fables from seeping into the domain of accepted wisdom.
Let’s consider the zero-sum bias. People across the globe tend to
believe that all resources are limited, even when this is not the
case. An isolationist might oppose immigration because they think
that immigrants “steal” from a fixed number of available jobs, not
realizing that immigrants also drive economic growth and create new
jobs.” (page 80)</p>
<p>“Game theory’s power lies in its expressiveness: it can convey
dynamic stories with simple mechanics. Unfortunately, game theory
has been used to launder dubious beliefs and present racist,
nativist policies as objective or inevitable. Some of these sinister
fables have been taken out of context and integrated into the
foundations of accepted common sense. If game theory continues to be
used as a model of human behavior, it needs major revisions to
reflect the fact that most people aren’t singularly focused on
personal gain. Even then, we’d be better off modeling people for
what they are: flexible learners.” (page 86)</p>
<p>“In his book <em>Economic Fables</em>, mathematician Ariel Rubinstein
likens game theory—mathematical abstractions of complex
situations—to fables with oversimple morals. We should be careful
not to mistake these for reality. Game theory should be studied for
its mathematical beauty, but it cannot pretend to tell us about the
real world. Rubinstein argues that even many academics don’t fully
understand it and often fail to communicate its limitations. This
would not be an issue if game theory remained a purely academic
pursuit. But it’s been adopted for use in modern systems that impact
billions of people worldwide.” (page 98)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“In 1930, Fisher collected and extended his genetic insights in his
opus, The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection, which almost
single-handedly revitalized Darwin’s ideas and rescued them from
years of neglect by academics. In the book, Fisher elaborates—in his
characteristically cryptic style—what is now one of the most
celebrated arguments in evolutionary biology and an early seed of
game-theoretic thinking in the life sciences.” (page 113)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The part I'm interested in here is that Fisher is said to have a
"characteristically cryptic style." This is the guy who wrote
"Statistical Methods for Research Workers" and "The Design of
Experiments." Is his cryptic style part of why frequentist statistics
is such a poorly understood mess?</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>“The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_equation">Price equation</a> is the fundamental theorem of evolution and
can be used to derive other basic theorems of evolution. The
equation’s generality lends it its power. This same generality
invites misuse from researchers unfamiliar with its nuances. Some
have dismissed it as a tautology, nothing more than a statistical
identity. Others have praised its depth.” (page 123)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>“Games remain an impressive way to evaluate a program’s
capabilities. In the early 1980s, graduate students Shafi Goldwasser
and Silvio Micali invented a powerful new form of mathematical proof
by imagining how they might play a secure poker game over the phone.
The resulting technique, interactive proof systems, consists of two
subparts, a prover and a verifier. These exchange messages until the
verifier is “convinced” that an answer is correct. Interactive
proofs became a foundational technique in computer science and
cryptography. They’re also the metaphoric heart of how we hope to
verify intelligence through games. Traditional math proofs are
inevitable, each step an irresistible conclusion unfolding from the
last. Interactive proofs, on the other hand, are probabilistically
true. By testing again and again, the verifier becomes increasingly
convinced of the prover’s claim. The Turing test, for instance, can
be mathematically formalized in this framework. Games take the same
form: human experts repeatedly test a game-playing computer program
to convince themselves of its capabilities. There is no single
measure of intelligence, or its mechanical approximation. Its
evaluation will be, by nature, interactive: the iterated probing of
a system.” (pages 137-138)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>“To borrow social theorist Sherry Turkle’s phrase, we too easily
abdicate authority to simulations. Simulations are ultimately
constrained by their creators’ assumptions: games are self-contained
universes ticking along to preprogrammed logic. They don’t
necessarily reflect anything fundamental about the world. Models’
conclusions are less interesting than the assumptions on which
they’re based—assumptions that are typically hidden.” (page 159)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Utopia is the process of making a better world, the name for one
path history can take, a dynamic, tumultuous, agonizing process,
with no end. Struggle forever.” (page 160, quoting Kim Stanley
Robinson)</p>
<p>“The game Moksha Patam (today’s Snakes and Ladders) is often
credited to the thirteenth-century Marathi saint Dnyaneshwar, though
it may have been invented hundreds of years earlier. It was designed
to teach players about karma and illustrate the precarity of fate.
In it, souls ascend to the heavenly realms, dragged down by vices
(snakes) and buoyed by virtues (ladders). Snakes are labeled with
the names of demons and the vices they represent, and players
recount stories from Hindu mythology as they play.” (page 160)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>“Scholars have sought to find a purely logical foundation for the
question of morality and how society should be structured. In the
mid-twentieth century, philosopher John Rawls began a line of
inquiry that culminated in his celebrated 1971 treatise, <em>A Theory
of Justice</em>. In this work, he posits fairness as the foundational
principle, or “first virtue,” on which society should be built.”
(page 163)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>“In the 1950s, game theorists discovered that some repeated games
support an infinite number of stable equilibrium strategies. This
became known as the folk theorem, because it was such an obvious
outcome that no one bothered formally publishing it.” (page 165)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>“Board game designer Reiner Knizia claims that the scoring system is
the most important part of designing a new game. It’s the score that
drives players’ behaviors. Similarly, in a subfield of game theory
known as mechanism design, or reverse game theory, mathematicians
design institutional rules that incentivize players to behave in
particular ways.” (page 174)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is pretty neat. Start with the end in mind, and then rather than
thinking we can influence people directly, imagine we can control "the
rules of the game" (through policy, etc.) - how do they get set up to
achieve the desired end? Possible connection also to "nudge" ideas,
etc.</p>    </article>
