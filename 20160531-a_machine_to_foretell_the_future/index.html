<h1>A Machine to Foretell the Future?</h1>
<p class="date">Tuesday May 31, 2016</p>
<p>In 1973 a collection of essays by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._F._Schumacher">E. F. Schumacher</a> was published as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Is_Beautiful">Small Is Beautiful: A Study of Economics As If People Mattered</a>. I don't always agree with him but I think there's a lot to consider in there, and it's an interesting view from the past—in turns prescient and archaic. The selection excerpted below includes an underrepresented viewpoint for people doing modern data work.</p>

<h3>A Machine to Foretell the Future?</h3>
<p>The reason for including a discussion on predictability in this volume
is that it represents one of the most important metaphysical—and
therefore practical—problems with which we are faced. There have never
been so many futurologists, planners, forecasters, and model-builders
as there are today, and the most intriguing product of technological
progress, the computer, seems to offer untold new possibilities.
People talk freely about “machines to foretell the future.” Are not
such machines just what we have been waiting for? All men at all times
have been wanting to know the future.</p>
<p>The ancient Chinese used to consult the <em>I Ching</em>, also called <em>The
Book of Changes</em> and reputed to be the oldest book of mankind. Some of
our contemporaries do so even today. The <em>I Ching</em> is based on the
conviction that, while everything changes all the time, change itself
is unchanging and conforms to certain ascertainable metaphysical laws.
“To everything there is a season,” said Ecclesiastes, “and a time to
every purpose under heaven ... a time to break down and a time to
build up ... a time to cast away stones and a time to gather stones
together,” or, as we might say, a time for expansion and a time for
consolidation. And the task of the wise man is to understand the great
rhythms of the Universe and to gear in with them. While the Greeks—and
I suppose most other nations—went to living oracles, to their Pythias,
Casandras, prophets and seers, the Chinese, remarkably, went to a book
setting out the universal and necessary pattern of changes, the very
Laws of Heaven to which all nature conforms inevitably and to which
man will conform freely as a result of insight gained either from
wisdom or from suffering. Modern man goes to the computer.</p>
<p>Tempting as it may be to compare the ancient oracles and the modern
computer, only a comparison by contrast is possible. The former deal
exclusively with qualities; the latter, with quantities. The
inscription over the Delphic temple was “Know Thyself,” while the
inscription on an electronic computer is more likely to be: “Know Me,”
that is, “Study the Operating Instructions before Plugging in.” It
might be thought that the <em>I Ching</em> and the oracles are metaphysical
while the computer model is “real”; but the fact remains that a
machine to foretell the future is based on metaphysical assumptions of
a very definite kind. It is based on the implicit assumption that “the
future is already here,” that it exists already in a determinate form,
so that it requires merely good instruments and good techniques to get
it into focus and make it visible. The reader will agree that this is
a very far-reaching metaphysical assumption, in fact, a most
extraordinary assumption which seems to go against all direct personal
experience. It implies that human freedom does not exist or, in any
case, that it cannot alter the predetermined course of events. We
cannot shut our eyes to the fact, on which I have been insisting
throughout this book, that such an assumption, like all metaphysical
theses, whether explicit or implicit, has decisive practical
consequences. The question is simply: is it true or is it untrue?</p>
<p>When the Lord created the world and people to live in it—an enterprise
which, according to modern science, took a very long time—I could well
imagine that He reasoned with Himself as follows: “If I make
everything predictable, these human beings, whom I have endowed with
pretty good brains, will undoubtedly learn to predict everything, and
they will thereupon have no motive to do anything at all, because they
will recognise that the future is totally determined and cannot be
influenced by any human action. On the other hand, if I make
everything unpredictable: they will gradually discover that there is
no rational basis for any decision whatsoever and, as in the first
case, they will thereupon have no motive to do anything at all.
Neither scheme would make sense. I must therefore create a mixture of
the two. Let some things be predictable and let others be
unpredictable. They will then, amongst many other things, have the
very important task of finding out which is which.”</p>
<p>And this, indeed, is a very important task, particularly today, when
people try to devise machines to foretell the future. Before anyone
makes a prediction, he should be able to give a convincing reason why
the factor to which his prediction refers is inherently predictable.</p>
<p>Planners, of course, proceed on the assumption that the future is not
“already here,” that they are not dealing with a predetermined—and
therefore predictable—system, that they can determine things by their
own free will, and that their plans will make the future different
from what it would have been had there been no plan. And yet it is the
planners, more than perhaps anyone else, who would like nothing better
than to have a machine to foretell the future. Do they ever wonder
whether the machine might incidentally also foretell their own plans
before they have been conceived?</p>
<h5>Need for Semantics</h5>
<p>However this may be, it is clear that the question of predictability
is not only important but also somewhat involved. We talk happily
about estimating, planning, forecasting, budgeting, about surveys,
programmes, targets, and so forth, and we tend to use these terms as
if they were freely interchangeable and as if everybody would
automatically know what was meant. The result is a great deal of
confusion, because it is in fact necessary to make a number of
fundamental distinctions. The terms we use may refer to the past or to
the future; they may refer to acts or to events; and they may signify
certainty or uncertainty. The number of combinations possible where
there are three pairs of this kind is \(2^3\), or 8, and we really
ought to have eight different terms to be quite certain of what we are
talking about. Our language, however, is not as perfect as that. The
most important distinction is generally that between acts and events.
The eight possible cases may there fore be ordered as follows:</p>
<pre><code>1. Act           5. Event
   Past             Past
   Certain          Certain
2. Act           6. Event
   Future           Future
   Certain          Certain
3. Act           7. Event
   Past             Past
   Uncertain        Uncertain
4. Act           8. Event
   Future           Future
   Uncertain        Uncertain</code></pre>

<p>The distinction between acts and events is as basic as that between
active and passive or between “within my control” or “outside my
control.” To apply the word “planning” to matters outside the
planner's control is absurd. Events, as far as the planner is
concerned, simply happen. He may be able to forecast them and this may
well influence his plan; but they cannot possibly be part of the plan.</p>
<p>The distinction between the past and the future proved to be necessary
for our purpose, because, in fact, words like “plan” or “estimate” are
being used to refer to either. If I say: “I shall not visit Paris
without a plan,” this can mean: “I shall arm myself with a street plan
for orientation” and would therefore refer to case 5. Or it can mean:
“I shall arm myself with a plan which outlines in advance where I am
going to go and how I am going to spend my time and money”—case 2
or 4. If someone claims that “to have a plan is indispensable,” it is
not without interest to find out whether he means the former or the
latter. The two are <em>essentially</em> different.</p>
<p>Similarly, the word “estimate,” which denotes uncertainty, may apply
to the past or to the future. In an ideal world, it would not be
necessary to make estimates about things that had already happened.
But in the actual world, there is much uncertainty even about matters
which, in principle, could be fully ascertained. Cases 3, 4, 7, and 8
represent four different types of estimates. Case 3 relates to
something I have done in the past; case 7, to something that has
happened in the past. Case 4 relates to something I plan to do in the
future, while case 8 relates to something I expect to happen in the
future. Case 8, in fact, is a forecast in the proper sense of the term
and has nothing whatever to do with “planning.” How often, however,
are forecasts presented as if they were plans—and <em>vice versa!</em> The
British “National Plan” of 1965 provides an outstanding example and,
not surprisingly, came to nothing.</p>
<p>Can we ever speak of future acts or events as certain (cases 2 and 6)?
If I have made a plan with full knowledge of all the relevant facts,
being inflexibly resolve to carry it through—case 2—I may, in this
respect, consider my future actions as certain. Similarly, in
laboratory science, dealing with carefully isolated deterministic
systems, future events may he described as certain. The real world,
however, is not a deterministic system; we may be able to talk with
certainty about acts or events of the past—cases 1 or 5—but we can do
so <em>about future events only on the basis of assumptions.</em> In other
words, we can formulate conditional statements about the future, such
as: “<em>If</em> such and such a trend of events continued for another x
years, this is where it would take us.” This is not a forecast or
prediction, which must always be uncertain in the real world, but an
exploratory calculation, which, being conditional, has the virtue of
mathematical certainty.</p>
<p>Endless confusion results from the semantic muddle in which we find
ourselves today. As mentioned before, “plans” are put forward which
upon inspection turn out to relate to events totally outside the
control of the planner. “Forecasts” are offered which upon inspection
turn out to be conditional sentences, in other words, exploratory
calculations. The latter are misinterpreted as if they were forecasts
or predictions. “Estimates” are put forward which upon inspection turn
out to be plans. And so on and so forth. Our academic teachers would
perform a most necessary and really helpful task if they taught their
students to make the distinctions discussed above and developed a
terminology which fixed them in words.</p>
<h5>Predictability</h5>
<p>Let us now return to our main subject—predictability. Is prediction or
forecasting—the two terms would seem to be interchangeable—possible at
all? The future does not exist; how could there be knowledge about
something nonexistent? This question is only too well justified. In
the strict sense of the word, knowledge can only be about the past.
The future is always in the making, but it is being made <em>largely</em> out
of existing material, about which a great deal can be known. The
future, there, is <em>largely</em> predictable, if we have solid and
extensive knowledge of the past. <em>Largely</em>, but by no means wholly;
for into the making of the future there enters that mysterious and
irrepressible factor called human freedom. It is the freedom of a
being of which it has been said that it was made in the image of God
the Creator: the freedom of creativity.</p>
<p>Strange to say, under the influence of laboratory science many people
today seem to use their freedom only for the purpose of denying its
existence. Men and women of great gifts find their purest delight in
magnifying every “mechanism,” every “inevitability,” everything where
human freedom does not enter or does not appear to enter. A great
shout of triumph goes up whenever anybody has found some further
evidence—in physiology or psychology or sociology or economics or
politics—of unfreedom, some further indication that people cannot help
being what they are and doing what they are doing, no matter how
inhuman their actions might be. The denial of freedom, of course, is a
denial of responsibility: there are no acts, but only events;
everything simply happens; no one is responsible. And this is no doubt
the main cause of the semantic confusion to which I have referred
above. It is also the cause for the belief that we shall soon have a
machine to foretell the future.</p>
<p>To be sure, if everything simply happened, if there were no element of
freedom, choice, human creativity and responsibility, everything would
be perfectly predictable, subject only to accidental and temporary
limitations of knowledge. The absence of freedom would make human
affairs suitable for study by the natural sciences or at least by
their methods, and reliable results would no doubt quickly follow the
systematic observation of facts. Professor Phelps Brown, in his
presidential address to the Royal Economic Society, appears to adopt
precisely this point of view when talking about “The Underdevelopment
of Economics.” “Our own science,” he says, “has hardly yet reached its
seventeenth century.” Believing that economics is <em>metaphysically</em> the
same as physics, he quotes another economist, Professor Morgenstern,
approvingly, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The decisive break which came in physics in the seventeenth century,
specifically in the field of mechanics, was possible only because of
previous developments in astronomy. It was backed by several
millennia of systematic, scientific, astronomical observation....
Nothing of this sort has occurred in economic science. It would have
been absurd in physics to have expected Kepler and Newton without
Tycho—and there is no reason to hope for an easier development in
economics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Professor Phelps Brown concludes therefore that we need many, many
more years of observations of behaviour. “<em>Until then, our
mathematisation is premature.</em>”</p>
<p>It is the intrusion of human freedom and responsibility that makes
economics metaphysically different from physics and makes human
affairs largely unpredictable. We obtain predictability, of course,
when we or others are acting according to a plan. But this is so
precisely because a plan is the result of an exercise in the freedom
of choice: the choice has been made; all alternatives have been
eliminated. If people stick to their plan, their behaviour is
predictable simply because they have chosen to surrender their freedom
to act otherwise than prescribed in the plan.</p>
<p>In principle, everything which is immune to the intrusion of human
freedom, like the movements of the stars, is predictable, and
everything subject to this intrusion is unpredictable. Does that mean
that all human actions are unpredictable? No, because most people,
most of the time, make no use of their freedom and act purely
mechanically. Experience shows that when we are dealing with large
numbers of people many aspects of their behaviour are indeed
predictable; for out of a large number, at any one time, only a tiny
minority are using their power of freedom, and they often do not
significantly affect the total outcome. Yet all really important
innovations and changes normally start from tiny minorities of people
who <em>do</em> use their creative freedom.</p>
<p>It is true that social phenomena acquire a certain steadiness and
predictability from the non-use of freedom, which means that the great
majority of people responds to a given situation in a way that does
not alter greatly in time, unless there are really overpowering new
causes.</p>
<p>We can therefore distinguish as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Full predictability (in principle) exists only in the absence of
    human freedom, <em>i.e.</em> in “sub-human” nature. The limitations of
    predictability are purely limitations of knowledge and technique.</li>
<li>Relative predictability exists with regard to the behaviour
    pattern of very large numbers of people doing “normal” things
    (routine).</li>
<li>Relatively full predictability exists with regard to human'
    actions controlled by a plan which eliminates freedom, <em>e.g.</em>
    railway timetable.</li>
<li>Individual decisions by individuals are in principle
    unpredictable.</li>
</ol>
<h5>Short-Term Forecasts</h5>
<p>In practice all prediction is simply extrapolation, modified by known
“plans.” But how do you extrapolate? How many years do you go back?
Assuming there is a record of growth, what precisely do you
extrapolate—the average rate of growth, or the increase in the rate of
growth, or the annual increment in absolute terms? As a matter of
fact. there are no rules: it is just a matter of “feel” or judgment.
(When there are seasonal or cyclical patterns, it is, of course,
necessary to go back by at least a year or a cycle; but it is a matter
of judgement to decide how many years or cycles.)</p>
<p>It is good to know of all the different possibilities of using the
same time series for extrapolations with very different results. Such
knowledge will prevent us from putting undue faith in any
extrapolation. At the same time, and by the same token, the
development of (what purport to be) better forecasting techniques can
become a vice. In short-term forecasting, say, for next year, a
refined technique rarely produces significantly different results from
those of a crude technique. After a year of growth—what can you
predict?</p>
<ol>
<li>that we have reached a (temporary) ceiling;</li>
<li>that growth will continue at the same, or a slower, or a faster
    rate;</li>
<li>that there will be a decline.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, it seems clear that the choice between these three basic
alternative predictions cannot be made by “forecasting technique” but
only by informed judgment. It depends, of course, on what you are
dealing with. When you have something that is normally growing very
fast, like the consumption of electricity, your threefold choice is
between the same rate of growth, a faster rate, or a slower rate.</p>
<p>It is not so much forecasting technique, as a full understanding of
the current situation shat can help in the formation of a sound
judgment for the future. If the present level of performance (or rate
of growth) is known to be influenced by quite abnormal factors which
are unlikely to apply in the coming year, it is, of course, necessary
to take these into account. The forecast, “same as last year,” may
imply a “real” growth or a “real” decline on account of exceptional
factors being present this year, and this, of course, must be made
explicit by the forecaster.</p>
<p>I believe, therefore, that all effort needs to be put into
understanding the current situation, to identify and, if need be,
eliminate “abnormal” and non-recurrent factors from the current
picture. This having been done, the method of forecasting can hardly
be crude enough. No amount of refinement will help one come to the
fundamental judgment—is next year going to be the same as last year,
or better, or worse?</p>
<p>At this point, it may be objected that there ought to be great
possibilities of short-term forecasting with the help of electronic
computers, because they can very easily and quickly handle a great
mass of data and fit to them some kind of mathematical expression. By
means of “feedback” the mathematical expression can be kept up to date
almost instantaneously, and once you have a really good mathematical
fit, the the machine can predict the future.</p>
<p>Once again, we need to have a look at the metaphysical basis of such
claims. What is the meaning of a “good mathematical fit?” Simply that
a sequence of quantitative changes in the past has been elegantly
described in precise mathematical language. But the fact that I—or the
machine—have been able to describe this sequence so exactly by no
means establishes a presumption that the pattern will continue. It
could continue only if <em>(a)</em> there were no human freedom and <em>(b)</em>
there was no possibility of any change in the causes that have given
rise to the observed pattern.</p>
<p>I should accept the claim that a very clear and very strongly
established pattern (of stability, growth, or decline) can be expected
to continue for a little longer, unless there is definite knowledge of
the arrival of new factors likely to change it. But I suggest that for
the detection of such clear, strong and persistent patterns the
non-electronic human brain is normally cheaper, faster, and more
reliable than its electronic rival. Or to put it the other way round:
if it is really necessary to apply such highly refined methods of
mathematical analysis for the detection of a pattern that one needs an
electronic computer, the pattern is too weak and too obscure to be a
suitable basis for extrapolation in real life.</p>
<p>Crude methods of forecasting—after the current picture has been
corrected for abnormalities—are not likely to lead into the errors of
spurious verisimilitude and spurious detailing—the two greatest vices
of the statistician. Once you have a formula and an electronic
computer, there is an awful temptation to squeeze the lemon until it
is dry and to present a picture of the future which through its very
precision and verisimilitude carries conviction. Yet a man who uses an
imaginary map, thinking it a true one, is likely to be worse off than
someone with no map at all; for he will fail to inquire wherever he
can, to observe every detail on his way, and to search continuously
with all his senses and all his intelligence for indications of where
he should go.</p>
<p>The person who makes the forecasts may still have a precise
appreciation of the assumptions on which they are based. But the
person who uses the forecasts may have no idea at all that the whole
edifice, as is often the case, stands and falls with one single,
unverifiable assumption. He is impressed by the thoroughness of the
job done, by the fact that everything seems to “add up,” and so forth.
If the forecasts were presented quite artlessly, as it were, on the
back of an envelope, he would have a much better chance of
appreciating their tenuous character and the fact that, forecasts or
no forecasts, someone has to take an entrepreneurial decision about
the unknown future.</p>
<h5>Planning</h5>
<p>I have already insisted that a plan is something essentially different
from a forecast. It is a statement of intention, of what the
planners—or their masters—intend to do. Planning (as I suggest the
term should be used) is inseparable from power. It is natural and
indeed desirable that everybody wielding any kind of power should have
some sort of a plan, that is to say, that he should use power
deliberately and consciously, looking some distance ahead in time. In
doing so he must consider what other people are likely to do; in other
words, he cannot plan sensibly without doing a certain amount of
forecasting. This is quite straightforward as long as that which has
to be forecast is, in fact, “forecastable,” if it relates either to
matters into which human freedom does not enter, or to the routine
actions of a very large number of individuals, or to the established
plans of other people wielding power. Unfortunately, the matters to be
forecast very often belong to none of these categories but are
dependent on the individual decisions of single persons or small
groups of persons. In such cases forecasts are little more than
“inspired guesses,” and no degree of improvement in forecasting
technique can help. Of course, some people may turn out to make better
guesses than others, but this will not be due to their possessing a
better forecasting technique or better mechanical equipment to help
them in their computations.</p>
<p>What, then, could be the meaning of a “national plan” in a free I
society? It cannot mean the concentration of all power at one point,
because that would imply the end of freedom: genuine planning is
coextensive with power. It seems to me that the only intelligible
meaning of the words “a national plan” in a free society would be the
fullest possible statement of intentions by all people wielding
substantial economic power, such statements being collected and
collated by some central agency. The very inconsistencies of such a
composite “plan” might give valuable pointers.</p>
<h5>Long-term Forecasts and Feasibility Studies</h5>
<p>Let us now turn to long-term forecasting, by which I mean producing
estimates dive or more years ahead. It must be clear that, change
being a function of time, the longer-term future is even less
predictable than the short-term. In fact, all long-term forecasting is
somewhat presumptuous and absurd, unless it is of so general a kind
that it merely states the obvious. All the same, there is often a
practical necessity for “taking a view” on the future, as decisions
have to be taken and long-term commitments entered. Is there nothing
that could help?</p>
<p>Here I should like to emphasise again the distinction between
forecasts on the one hand and “exploratory calculations” or
“feasibility studies” on the other. In the one case I assert that this
or that will be the position in, say, twenty years' time. In the other
case I merely explore the long-term effect of certain assumed
tendencies. It is unfortunately true that in macro-economics
feasibility studies are very rarely carried beyond the most
rudimentary beginnings. People are content to rely on general
forecasts which are rarely worth the paper they are written on.</p>
<p>It may be helpful if I give a few examples. It is very topical these
days to talk about the development of underdeveloped countries and
countless “plans” (so-called) are being produced to this end. If we go
by the expectations that are being aroused all over the world, it
appears to be assumed that within a few decades most people the world
over are going to be able to live more or less as the western
Europeans are living today. Now, it seems to me, it would be very
instructive if someone undertook to make a proper, detailed
feasibility study of this project. He might choose the year 2000 as
the terminal date and work backwards from there. What would be the
required output of foodstuffs, fuels, metals, textile fibres, and so
forth? What would be the stock of industrial capital? Naturally, he
would have to introduce many new assumptions as he went along. Each
assumption could then become the object of a further feasibility
study. He might then find that he could not solve his equations unless
he introduced assumptions which transcended all bounds of reasonable
probability. This might prove highly instructive. It might conceivably
lead to the conclusion that, while most certainly there ought to be
substantial economic development throughout the countries where great
masses of people live in abject misery, there are certain choices
between alternative <em>patterns</em> of development that could be made, and
that some types of development would appear more feasible than others.</p>
<p>Long-term thinking, supported by conscientious feasibility studies,
would seem to be particularly desirable with regard to all
non-renewable raw materials of limited availability, that is to say,
mainly fossil fuels and metals. At present, for instance, there is a
replacement of coal or oil. Some people seem to assume that coal is on
the way out. A careful feasibility study, making use of all available
evidence of coal, oil, and natural gas reserves, proved as well as
merely assumed to exist, would be exceedingly instructive.</p>
<p>On the subject of population increase and food supplies, we have had
the nearest thing to feasibility studies so far, coming mainly from
United Nations organisations. They might be carried much further,
giving not only the totals of food production to be attained by 1980
or 2000, but also showing in much greater detail than has so far been
done the timetable of specific steps that would have to be taken in
the near future if these totals are to be attained.</p>
<p>In all this, the most essential need is a purely intellectual one: a
clear appreciation of the difference between a forecast and a
feasibility study. It is surely a sign of statistical illiteracy to
confuse the two. A long-term forecast, as I said, is presumptuous; but
a long- term feasibility study is a piece of humble and unpretentious
work which we shall neglect at our peril.</p>
<p>Again the question arises whether this work could be facilitated by
more mechanical aids such as electronic computers. Personally, I am
inclined to doubt it. It seems to me that the endless multiplication
of mechanical aids in fields which require judgment more than anything
else is one of the chief dynamic forces behind Parkinson's Law. Of
course, an electronic computer can work out a vast number of
permutations, employing varying assumptions, within a few seconds or
minutes, while it might take the non-electronic brain as many months
to do the same job. But the point is that the non-electronic brain
need never attempt to do that job. By the power of judgment it can
concentrate on a few decisive parameters which are quite sufficient to
outline the ranges of reasonable probability. Some people imagine that
it would be possible and helpful to set up a machine for long-range
forecasting into which current “news” could be fed continuously and
which, in response, would produce continual revisions of some
long-term forecasts. No doubt, this would be possible; but would it be
helpful? Each item of “news” has to be judged for its long-term
relevance, and a sound judgment is generally not possible immediately.
Nor can I see any value in the continual revision of long-term
forecasts, as a matter of mechanical routine. A forecast is required
only when a long-term decision has to be taken or reviewed, which is a
comparatively rare event even in the largest of businesses, and then
it is worth while deliberately and conscientiously to assemble the
best evidence, to judge each item in the light of accumulated
experience, and finally to come to a view which appears reasonable to
the best brains available. It is a matter of self-deception that this
laborious and uncertain process could be short-circuited by a piece of
mechanical apparatus.</p>
<p>When it comes to feasibility studies, as distinct from forecasts, it
may occasionally seem useful to have apparatus which can quickly test
the effect of variations in one's assumptions. But I have yet to be
convinced that a slide rule and a set of compound interest tables are
not quite sufficient for the purpose.</p>
<h5>Unpredictability and Freedom</h5>
<p>If I hold a rather negative opinion about the usefulness of
“automation” in matters of economic forecasting and the like, I do not
underestimate the value of electronic computers and similar apparatus
for other tasks, like solving mathematical problems or programming
production runs. These latter tasks belong to the exact sciences or
their applications. Their subject matter is non-human, or perhaps I
should say, sub-human. Their very exactitude is a sign of the absence
of human freedom, the absence of choice, responsibility and dignity.
As soon as human freedom enters, we are in an entirely different world
where there is great danger in any proliferation of mechanical
devices. The tendencies which attempt to obliterate the distinction
should be resisted with the utmost determination. Great damage to
human dignity has resulted from the misguided attempt of the social
sciences to adopt and imitate the methods of the natural sciences.
Economics, and even more so, applied economics, is not an exact
science; it is in fact, or ought to be, something much greater: a
branch of wisdom. Mr. Colin Clark once claimed “that long-period world
economic equilibrium develop themselves in their own peculiar manner,
entirely independently of political and social changes.” On the
strength of this metaphysical heresy he wrote a book, in 1941,
entitled <em>The Economics of 1960</em>. It would be unjust to say that the
picture he drew bears no resemblance to what actually came to pass;
there is, indeed, the kind of resemblance which simply stems from the
fact that man uses his freedom within an unchanged setting of physical
laws of nature. But the lesson from Mr. Clark's book is that his
metaphysical assumption is untrue; that, in fact, world economic
equilibria, even in the longer run, are highly dependent on political
and social changes; and that the sophisticated and ingenious methods
of forecasting employed by Mr. Clark merely served to produce a work
of spurious verisimilitude.</p>
<h5>Conclusion</h5>
<p>I thus come to the cheerful conclusion that life, including economic
life, is still worth living because it is sufficiently unpredictable
to be interesting. Neither the economist nor the statistician will get
it “taped.” Within the limits of the physical laws of nature, we are
still masters of our individual and collective destiny, for good or
ill.</p>
<p>But the know-how of the economist, the statistician, the natural
scientist and engineer, and even of the genuine philosopher can help
to clarify the limits within which our destiny is confined. The future
cannot be forecast, but it can be explored. Feasibility studies can
show us where we appear to be going, and this is more important today
than ever before, since “growth” has become a keynote of economics all
over the world.</p>
<p>In his urgent attempt to obtain reliable knowledge about his
essentially indeterminate future, the modern man of action may
surround himself by ever-growing armies of forecasters, by
ever-growing mountains of factual data to be digested by ever more
wonderful mechanical contrivances: I fear that the result is little
more than a huge game of make-believe and an ever more marvellous
vindication of Parkinson's Law. The best decisions will still be based
on the judgments of mature non-electronic brains possessed by men who
have looked steadily and calmly at the situation and seen it whole.
“Stop, look, and listen” is a better motto than “Look it up in the
forecasts.”</p>
