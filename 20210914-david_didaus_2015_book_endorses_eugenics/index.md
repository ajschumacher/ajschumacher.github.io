# David Didau's 2015 book endorses eugenics

The most salient thing about Didau's _What if everything you knew
about education was wrong?_ turns out to be that it has an appendix by
[Andrew Sabisky][] which recommends as an "excellent and readable
introduction to behavior genetics" an [infamous article][] by
eugenicist [Arthur Jensen][], among other more and less explicitly
racist, backward things.

[Andrew Sabisky]: https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/17/andrew-sabisky-boris-johnsons-ex-adviser-in-his-own-words
[infamous article]: https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED023722.pdf
[Arthur Jensen]: https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/arthur-jensen

This harmful propaganda was not only published, but also hasn't been
corrected since. The book is still for sale. Didau's [site][] still
says "Andrew Sabisky has elegantly debunked a series of the most
enduring edu-myths about intelligence" in it. While in a
[later book][] Didau describes eugenics as "an unpleasant and
inherently racist ideology" (page 96) he hasn't disavowed the contents
of his earlier book, including when asked directly ([1][], [2][]).

[2]: https://twitter.com/planarrowspace/status/1433458397647708163

Didau's chapters themselves dog-whistle a little more subtly, as when
he smirks at political correctness by referencing an
[obscure incident][] (page 76) or (in his [later book][]) disparages a
feminist paper without considering its contents (page 204).

The book otherwise advocates for explicit instruction and trying to
get kids to remember things via, for example, spaced repetition. Didau
supports a knowledge-rich curriculum like [Hirsch][] and wants
everybody to stop hassling teachers so much. His thinking here reminds
me of a [meme][] from
[Seven Years of Spaced Repetition Software in the Classroom][].

While this is always the case, I feel like it's especially important
with a book like this for me to point out that selected quotes below
do not indicate my agreement with or support for any particular quote.

> "To make things even more challenging for us as learners and/or
> teachers, conditions of instruction or practice that appear to

I'm not sure that's quite what others mean by [enactivism][]...

This cites "Evidence That Smaller Schools Do Not Improve Student
Achievement" by Wainer and Zwerling.

On page 55 he talks about the British system of "target grades", which
is surprising and weird to me. Every student gets some explicit target
grade for their big exams at the end of high school. Wacky. He cites a
[blog post][].

[blog post]: https://othmarstrombone.wordpress.com/2014/07/18/how-to-eat-50-hot-dogs-in-12-minutes-and-why-setting-targets-may-hold-back-progress/

After talking to Jay about this, it's possible having "target grades"
isn't so different from how things often play out in the US, when
student performance on standardized tests sorts them into tracked
classes... Not exactly the same thing, but maybe not _so_ foreign.

I hadn't heard of "thought-showering" instead of "brain-storming"...
The phrase seems to have had a [short history][]. The citation of
[Productivity Loss in Brainstorming Groups: A Meta-Analytic Integration][]
is more relevant. (page 76)

That highly opinionated bit contrasts with this nearby selection:

> "Teaching cannot be child centered and teacher led at the same time.

He's trying to make an argument here, and it might even be right, but
he isn't making it very well.

This is quite a claim.

On page 111, I was interested to see the
[Cone of Experience][]/"Learning Pyramid" ("people remember X% of what
they Y") debunked. I remember seeing a poster version back in middle
school, and I never questioned it. Didau cites
[Multimodal Learning Through Media][], which opens with a good
critique of the "Learning Pyramid" thing.

I like this, but maybe it's not an "instead of" but "in addition

For someone who doesn't like discovery learning, this seems similar to
discovery learning...

For something that's "the master skill", this topic isn't given much
attention... There is some though...

Sabisky references, as an "excellent and readable introduction to
behavior genetics", the article
[How much can we boost IQ and scholastic achievement?][] by
[Arthur Jensen][]. So while Sabisky is a little racist and eugenicist
in his appendix, he's citing (and recommending, even) very racist,
very eugenicist sources.
