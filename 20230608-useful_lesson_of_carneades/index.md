Carneades is sometimes interpreted as demonstrating only “that every
conclusion is unwarranted.” ([Russell][], p. 236) The skeptic is
correct as such, but has not yet offered useful advice. The useful
lesson of Carneades is that rhetoric should be wielded responsibly to
create the world we want. In expelling Carneades from Rome,
[Cato the Censor][] may or may not have acted wisely, but it seems he
understood the lesson.
