# Matilda, by Dahl

A local middle school put on Matilda, the musical, which made me
curious enough to read the [book][]. It's strange and cute. It's very
episodic, with the main resolution appearing with less warning in the
book than the musical. Apparently in early versions of the book
Matilda was even more malicious.
