# The Ride of a Lifetime, by Iger

[Bob][] starts chapter one with “This book is not a memoir,” so you
know from the start you're dealing with an unreliable narrator.
Compared to Catmull in [Creativity, Inc.][], Iger does seem more
direct, and his experiences are interesting, but I like Iger less, I
think.

3.  Focus
4.  Decisiveness
5.  Curiosity
6.  Fairness
7.  Thoughtfulness
8.  Authenticity
9.  The Relentless Pursuit of Perfection
10. Integrity

On page 9, you get a story of how some coworker exposed himself to
Iger.

I wonder if the old TV business is analogous to the current tech
scene...

This is legit.

haha~

This guy, huh?

Concur.

Concur.

Crazy micro-managing board member...

This guy, huh? He elsewhere makes a point of how he didn't take a
two-week vacation until late in his career.

This is one of the more interesting things he actually did, moving
toward more decentralization. Seems good.

> "We landed on Twitter." (page 190)

I didn't realize Disney had been close to acquiring Twitter!

This is interesting too; kind of the reverse of decentralization, but
I like how it gets away from purely quantified compensation.

> "My new retirement date is December 2021," (page 221)

[Bob][]'s Wikipedia page makes it seem like this was not the initial
plan, but here it seems like it was?
