# Predicting the future from 2022

[DRAFT]

For the third year in a row ([2020][], [2021][]) I consider what might
happen. I continue to mostly imagine current trends continue, and
throw in some extra stuff for fun.

### By 2023 (1 year from now)

 * Omicron is the last major Covid variant, but supply chain and
   workforce issues continue to be hard all year.
 * Democrats become minorities in the House and Senate in 2022 US elections.
 * [Queen Elizabeth][] is dead. (Recommended by Tonia.)
 * Inflation carries on around 5%.
 * S&P 500 closes above 5,000.

### By 2027 (5 years from now)

 * Democratic candidate wins presidency in 2024 US election.
 * Inflation around 2%.
 * Global population exceeds 8 billion for the first time in 2023
   ([predicted][] by the UN).
 * Total population between 8,221,264 and 8,333,078 (low/med
   [predicted][] by the UN).
 * S&P 500 closes above 7,000.

### By 2032 (10 years from now)

 * Texas has non-zero state income tax and plenty of climate and
   infrastructure things to spend on.
 * [Zendaya][] wins an Oscar.
 * At least one European nation has something identifiable as [UBI][].
 * Total population between 8,445,932 and 8,687,228 (low/med
   [predicted][] by the UN).
 * S&P 500 closes above 9,000.

### By 2042 (20 years from now)

 * The US effectively has [UBI][], but it isn't called that. Maybe a
   patchwork of policies.
 * At least one international advertising campaign intended to
   encourage immigration to the US by ameliorating the reputation of
   unemployed Americans.
 * Total population between 8,769,695 and 9,315,508 (low/med
   [predicted][] by the UN).
 * S&P 500 closes above 15,000.

### Trends

 * I think global population growth will be _slightly_ slower than the
   medium variant [predicted][] by the UN. Covid might contribute a
   little, but I think this is mostly from efforts like Bill Gates's,
   possibly Belt and Road, and general technology and modernization.
 * Climate change continues. More fires, more floods, more droughts,
   more storms. Climate action continues to be nominal.
 * It keeps being easy/easier to fake things.
     * Lots of cheap/low-quality stuff.
     * The value of direct human relationships/trust stays very
       high/grows. Elite college education keeps getting more
       valuable.
 * Inequality continues to grow.
     * Extreme poverty continues to decline; the bottom of the range
       is higher than previously. In some places, there may be [UBI][]
       eventually.
     * But the gap between the bottom of the range and the top grows.
 * More legalization of drugs.
 * There will continue to be more real problems with not having enough
   people to work than there are with having too many people put out
   of work by technology.

### Reviewing past predictions

I was a little crazy in [2021][]. Depending on the level of generosity
in interpretation, I was somewhere from 1/4 to 4/4 on one-year
predictions. None of my longer-term predictions have materialized.
Still no aliens.

From [2020][]: Hong Kong [seems to be][] pretty well controlled by the
mainland now.
