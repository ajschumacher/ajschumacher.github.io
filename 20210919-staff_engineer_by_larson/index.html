<h1>Staff Engineer, by Larson</h1>
<p class="date">Sunday September 19, 2021</p>
<p>It's all <a href="https://staffeng.com/">online for free too</a>, but I enjoyed reading a paper copy
of <a href="https://lethain.com/">Larson</a>'s <a href="https://staffeng.com/guides">Staff Engineer</a>. (Well: I skimmed some of the
interviews that pad out the page count.) I really liked the use of QR
codes with the endnote links. That could work well in Tufte-style
margins too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"There's a popular vision of heroic leadership that centers on
extraordinarily productive individuals whose decisions change their
company's future. Most of those narratives are intentionally
designed by public relations teams to create a good story. You're
far more likely to change your company's long-term trajectory by
growing the engineers around you than through personal heroics. The
best way to grow those around you is by creating an active practice
of mentorship and sponsorship." (page 22)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"It might be addressing the sudden realization that your primary
database only has three months of remaining disk space, and you
can't upgrade to a larger size (in my experience, a surprisingly
frequent problem at fast-growing startups)." (page 24)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"For mentorship and sponsorship, spend some time with Lara Hogan's
<a href="https://larahogan.me/blog/what-sponsorship-looks-like/">What Does Sponsorship Look Like?</a>, and for being glue, spend time
with Tanya Reilly's piece that bore the phrase, <a href="https://noidea.dog/glue">Being Glue</a>."

<blockquote>
<p>"The first place to look for work that matters is exploring whether
your company is experiencing an existential risk." (page 39)</p>

<p>"Foster growth" (page 40)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Specific statements create alignment; generic statements create the
illusion of alignment." (page 47)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"There's no such thing as winning, only learning and earning the
chance to keep playing." (page 52)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reminds me of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_and_Infinite_Games">Finite and Infinite Games</a>.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Premature processes add more friction than value and are quick to
expose themselves as ineffective." (page 43)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"There's the old joke about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarbanes%E2%80%93Oxley_Act">Sarbannes-Oxley</a> [sic]: it doesn't
reduce risk; it just makes it clear to blame when things go wrong."

<blockquote>
<p>"... adopting the "define errors out of existence" approach
described in A Philosophy of Software Design." (page 54)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At a quick look, it seems like this is something like "give your
functions defaults rather than exceptions" so if you ask for something
out of range, for example, you get the last thing rather than throwing.</p>

<p>"Genuine best practice has to be supported by research, and the best
source of research on this topic is <a href="https://itrevolution.com/accelerate-book/">Accelerate</a>." (page 56)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"When it comes to complex systems and interdependencies, moving
quickly is just optics. It's methodical movement that gets the job
done." (page 69)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"I think this is the most important lesson I've learned over the
past few years: the most effective leaders spend more time following
than they do leading. This idea also comes up in the idea of the
"<a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/derek_sivers_how_to_start_a_movement">the first follower creates a leader</a>," but effective leaders
don't split the world into a leader and follower dichotomy, rather
they move in and out of the leadership and follower roles with the
folks around them." (page 76)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"There's a well-worn model of genius encapsulated in
<a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?FeynmanAlgorithm">the Feynman algorithm</a>: "1) Write down a problem. 2) Think very
hard. 3) Write down the solution." This mystical view of genius is
both unapproachable and discouraging. It's also unrealistic, but
it's hard for folks to know it's unrealistic if we don't write down
our thinking process for others to follow. By writing down the
process of finding an answer, as well as the rationale for the
answer, folks around us can being to <em>learn from</em> our decisions
rather than simply being <em>directed</em> by them" (page 85)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Barbara Minto, whose The Pyramid Principle is the most influential
work on effective business communication, is also a big fan of
structure: "Controlling the sequence in which you present your ideas
is the single most important act necessary to clear writing. The
clearest sequence is always to give the summarizing idea before you
give the individual ideas being summarized. I cannot emphasize this
point too much."" (page 96)</p>

<p>"Whether your company does ad-hoc promotions or uses a calibration
process, promotions are a team activity and as Julia Grace, then of
Slack, advised me once during a job search, "Don't play team games
along, you'll lose."" (page 110)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Share weekly notes of your work to your team and stakeholders in a
way that other folks can get access to your notes if they're
interested" (page 128)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"The flying wedge pattern of one senior leader joining a company and
then bringing on their previous coworkers is a well-known and
justifiably-despised pattern that relies on this built-in
referrer-as-sponsor, but it doesn't have to be toxic if done
sparingly." (page 139)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"There are some wonderful engineering leaders creating pockets of
equitable access to Staff-plus roles, but those pockets can quickly
turn into a <a href="https://lethain.com/values-oasis/">Values Oasis</a> that can't sustain itself once the
sponsoring leader departs the company or changes roles." (page 139)</p>

<p>"Back in 2012, Patrick McKenzie wrote <a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/">Salary Negotiation</a>, which
has since become the defacto [sic] guide to negotiating salaries for
software engineers." (page 145)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Staff-plus is all about enabling other people to do better work -
to be a force multiplier." (page 184, from Bert Fan)</p>

<p>"This is not a meritocracy and your professional network is
important." (page 186, from Bert Fan)</p>

currently know." (page 209, from Ritu Vincent)</p>

<p>"In the quest for efficiency over effectiveness, many companies trap
their managers in a staggering amount of coordination and
bureaucracy." (page 309)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"When we talk about designing a Staff-plus engineer interview loop,
the first thing to talk about is that absolutely no one is confident
their Staff-plus interview loop works well." (page 312)</p>
