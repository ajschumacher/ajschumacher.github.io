# Staff Engineer, by Larson


It's all [online for free too][], but I enjoyed reading a paper copy
of [Larson][]'s [Staff Engineer][]. (Well: I skimmed some of the
interviews that pad out the page count.) I really liked the use of QR
codes with the endnote links. That could work well in Tufte-style
margins too.

> "There's a popular vision of heroic leadership that centers on
> extraordinarily productive individuals whose decisions change their
> company's future. Most of those narratives are intentionally
> designed by public relations teams to create a good story. You're
> far more likely to change your company's long-term trajectory by
> growing the engineers around you than through personal heroics. The
> best way to grow those around you is by creating an active practice
> of mentorship and sponsorship." (page 22)

Reminds me of [Finite and Infinite Games][].

At a quick look, it seems like this is something like "give your
functions defaults rather than exceptions" so if you ask for something
out of range, for example, you get the last thing rather than throwing.
