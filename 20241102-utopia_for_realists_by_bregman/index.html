<h1>(Audio) Utopia for Realists, by Bregman</h1>
<p class="date">Saturday November  2, 2024</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia_for_Realists">Utopia for Realists</a> is a more accessible <a href="/20240929-inventing_the_future_by_srnicek_and_williams/" title="(Audio) Inventing the Future, by Srnicek and Williams">Inventing the Future</a>:
it's in favor of UBI and less work, against neoliberalism/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mont_Pelerin_Society" title="Mont Pelerin Society">MPS</a>, and
Utopia's "underdog socialism" is like Inventing's "folk politics." It
differs slightly in being explicitly for open borders, like
<a href="/20191109-open_borders_by_caplan_and_weinersmith/" title="Open Borders, by Caplan and Weinersmith">Caplan</a>, and there are some other differences in focus and
examples. The original Dutch title is literally "free money for
everyone."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do.” (Oscar
Wilde, quoted page 68)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think Bregman is too concerned with preserving the appearance of the
Puritan work ethic. Like many, he seems to think that giving people
money has to be shown not to reduce hours of work. This is silly and
backward. We should be trying to get people to stop working for pay.</p>
<p>I think it's fine to pull in <a href="/20180218-scarcity_by_sendhil_mullainathan_and_eldar_shafir/" title="Scarcity by Sendhil Mullainathan and Eldar Shafir">Mullainathan and Shafir</a>, as he does,
on the downsides of scarcity, but the reasoning should be that it is
unjust to let people be in bad situations. The trap here is getting
into an argument about who is deserving. If we have to prove that
people are deserving, we've lost already.</p>
<p>Some neat stuff:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockaigne">Cockaigne</a>: "a land of plenty in medieval myth"</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speenhamland_system">Speenhamland</a>: 1795 "basic income" program, still argued over:
   Did it suppress wages? Did it increase sloth? More children? Loose
   morals?</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mincome">Mincome</a>: "Manitoba Basic Annual Income Experiment" (1970s)</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiocracy">Physiocracy</a>: some kind of economic theory that valued the
   productivity of land/agriculture (over generic labor, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>And there's a chapter on GDP (etc.) which made me think that one could
teach a whole course on the downsides or risks of data and data
science, much as in <a href="/20200425-tyranny_of_metrics_by_muller/" title="The Tyranny of Metrics, by Muller">The Tyranny of Metrics</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The RAND Corporation, an influential think tank, foresaw a future
in which just 2% of the population would be able to produce
everything society needed.” (page 18)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But this cites not a RAND study, but “Hillel Ruskin (ed.), Leisure,
Toward a Theory and Policy (1984), p. 152,” and I don't see that
online, so it'll take me a while to check.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>“Not until 1978 was the plan for a basic income shelved once and for
all, however, following a fatal discovery upon publication of the
final results of the Seattle experiment. One finding in particular
grabbed everybody’s attention: The number of divorces had jumped
more than 50%. Interest in this statistic quickly overshadowed all
the other outcomes, such as better school performance and
improvements in health. A basic income, evidently, gave women too
much independence.</p>
<p>Ten years later, a reanalysis of the data revealed that a
statistical error had been made; in reality, there had been no
change in the divorce rate at all.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The citation here is <a href="https://www.irp.wisc.edu/publications/dps/pdfs/dp85788.pdf">Cain and Wissoker</a>... I've heard about this
divorce finding before ("It's bad!" "It's good!") but I don't think
I've heard about this nullifying result... Why not? I'm not digging
very deep here, but Bregman seems quite Pollyannaish in general
throughout the book, which makes him seem less reliable in general on
specifics.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>“The free books had made no difference. Test scores showed no
improvement.” (page 91)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But this isn't quite what the <a href="http://www.econ.yale.edu/~egcenter/infoconf/kremer_paper.pdf">study</a> said - and I didn't even read
beyond the abstract! "However, for those students in the top quintile
of the distribution of initial academic achievement, the program
raised test scores by at least 0.2 standard deviations."</p>    </article>
