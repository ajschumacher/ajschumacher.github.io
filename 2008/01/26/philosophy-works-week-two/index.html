<h1>Philosophy Works: Week Two</h1>

<p>I got to my second Saturday class at the School of Practical Philosophy a little earlier, so I sat in the back room, which is decorated in what I'm inclined to call a Victorian style, all white and ornate.  On Saturdays the two rooms on the second floor are both full, and two tutors lead two sections simultaneously.<br><br>The tutor for today's section was a good deal more of a rambler.   I was less fond of him.   I was also more tired, grumpier and caffeinated, so it may not have been entirely to do with him.  I additionally entertained hostile thoughts for the gleefully talkative older members of this room's audience.   How dare they not share my cynicism?<br><br>The main content for the day was contained in two simple diagrams called "triads".  The first one is composed of external stimuli, desire, and action.  This is described as a mechanical cycle, or "the picture of a limited life".  The second triad has essential desires, habitual desired, and effort.  The word effort was broken down to mean "from strength".  These diagrams were supposed to explain something, I guess.<br><br>The tutor also led the group twice through "The Exercise" awareness meditation, and there were a few parables or fables involving animals.  Self knowledge and observation were themes, but the whole session seemed to lack coherence.  It couldn't have helped that I was in a kind of fog myself.  Fog or not, I feel I have growing criticisms of the philosophy as such that I will have to expand later.</p>

<p>After class I explored the neighborhood a little.  I had an expensive sandwich called "The Spa" with avocado and sun-dried tomatoes and drank fresh-pressed juice from carrots, bananas, and apples.  Walking toward the Met, I found that across the street from the School of Practical Philosophy is the first Waldorf school in the United States.  Some of its eighth-graders were advertising a fund-raising sale on the sidewalk out front.  They had knit hats, among other things.  I happen to know a little about Waldorf schools because they're in the same class of alternative educational schemes as Montessori schools, which I was and am interested in.  I wished them luck and walked into the Met, but decided I didn't really care to wander around inside for a suggested contribution of $20.  On my way to the subway on Lexington, I discovered that All Souls, the Unitarian church mentioned <a href="/2008/01/19/subway-philosophy/">earlier</a>, is within two blocks of the School of Practical Philosophy.  This whole region seems to somehow be a hotbed of upper class mysticism, a suit-wearing hippy land.<br><br><br>Subway Philosophy<br><a href="/2008/01/19/subway-philosophy/">Week One</a><br>Week Two<br><a href="/2008/02/02/practical-philosophy/">Week Three</a></p>
