<h1>Free-standing newspaper and tape structures</h1>
<p class="date">Friday January 18, 2008</p>
<p>I've taken to writing brief letters to members of my immediate family on the occasions of their birthdays.  When Noelle was turning six, I fleshed out the letter beyond "Happy birthday" by challenging her to make the tallest free-standing structure she could using only newspaper and tape.

<br><br>

My letter was lost in Menasha for some time, but then this week I got a reply in the mail, with a picture from Noelle and a message scribed by my mom.  I was pleased that Noelle had actually attempted the task, and if her results were unspectacular, perhaps it was not such a bad effort for a six-year-old.<br><br>Having been challenged by a six-year-old, however, I had little choice but to develop an answer to the little engineer's question: "How big is yours?"<br><br>I used an issue of The New York Times and Scotch tape.  With no limits on the amounts of these materials, you can really do a lot.  I elected to transform full newspaper pages into tubes of fairly small diameter and base my construction on these elements.  You can get a very small diameter if you wrap the paper around a pencil initially, which makes for a fairly rigid beam.  I only made one in this way, however.  The other eleven were slightly looser.

I think construction from thin tubes in this way is a pretty good approach, although there may be others.  The particular constraints and possibilities of the problem as a whole make for a nice and easily implemented design activity.  I think it could be used easily in schools at a wide range of levels, for problem solving, engineering, team building, or even mathematics.<br><br>My initial idea was to tape the tubes as the edges of a triangular prism.  I somehow didn't realize that this structure is not rigid and that taping the corners would be difficult.  Next I tried a tetrahedron, which is rigid but does not easily suggest a lot of height.  Investigating how best to join the corners of a tetrahedron, I hit upon the design I settled on, made from components of three tubes joined at their centers like three-dimensional Cartesian axes, and then stacked.  Four of these components, for a total of 12 page-tubes, reached 4' 10".  I am confident considerably more impressive results could be had from more refined efforts.<br><br><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="photo3.jpg"><img src="photo3.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5156825340020933250" border="0"></a><br>How big is yours?</p>
