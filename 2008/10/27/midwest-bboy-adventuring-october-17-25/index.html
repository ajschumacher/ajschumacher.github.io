<h1>Midwest Bboy Adventuring, October 17-25, 2008</h1>
<p class="date">Monday October 27, 2008</p>
<p>I traveled these nine days throughout Wisconsin, Illinois, and Minnesota, following bboy events and practices and having a fantastic time.  A conservative estimate is 1,746 miles driven, which neglects travel within cities.  Thanks to all those who came with me, who practiced, cyphered, and battled with or against me, and especially to those who helped out with a much-needed place to sleep in the night.<br><br><span>2008 October 17 Friday</span><br><span>Menasha to Milwaukee</span> 104 miles<br>Dinner at the restaurant where my sister works, Cafe Centraal, and then the Veggietales live show with my little sisters.
