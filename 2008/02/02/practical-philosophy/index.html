<h1>Practical Philosophy</h1>
<p class="date">Saturday February  2, 2008</p>
<div>
<p>The folks at <a href="http://philosophyworks.org/">The School of Practical Philosophy</a> are really quite keen on that Practical bit.  They give you practices.  In the first week, we got and did a thing called "The Exercise", and have done it again in the second and third classes.  It's also on eight-and-a-half-by-eleven in our binders, and additionally printed on a special card.  Here it is:

<br><br>

We were supposed to be doing it twice a day for the last two weeks.  Today we did a new practice which is called The Pause.  It's like The Exercise but shorter.  You're supposed to be still for a moment and focus on one sense.  It's a sort of micro-meditation, and well-named besides.<br><br>The main content of this class was "Levels of Awareness", although we spent a lot of time discussing attachment and sharing personal stories of trying to apply the question "What would a wise person do?"  Some people shared things that I would probably have considered too private to bring out in that environment.  Anyway, here are the levels of awareness from my notes:<br></p>
<ul>
<li>Higher states of consciousness</li>
<li>Fully awake</li>
<li>Awakening consciousness</li>
<li>Waking sleep</li>
<li>Dream</li>
<li>Deep sleep</li>
</ul>It was claimed that most people spend most of their allegedly awake time at the "waking sleep" level.<br><br>I had to run part of the way through Central Park to get there on time, but I did, and this time I chose to go back to the room and teacher (Roland) from my first week.  He's a private school administrator, seems a little like Mr. Rogers, and is a wonder just to watch for his teacherly demeanor.  Today I was particularly impressed with how he handled a participant's wildly off-topic response to a question.  Without ever losing a beat he addressed the response positively, affirming the speaker, and then gently returned to the question he had actually asked.  My response as a teacher in that situation might easily have been wide-mouthed and probably insulting flabergastion.<br><br>One weirdness from the day: several times Roland spoke of something taking multiple lifetimes, in a way that could be purely colloquial or could indicate a literal belief in reincarnation.  Is that a part of the school's curriculum, I wonder?<br><br><br>Subway Philosophy<br><a href="/2008/01/19/subway-philosophy/">Week One</a><br><a href="/2008/01/26/philosophy-works-week-two/">Week Two</a><br>Week Three</div>
