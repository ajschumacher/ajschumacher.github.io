Now running Python 3.8.11!

Weirdnesses:

 * Five dashes ("-----") start and end slides that get made into
   [big][] slides in `big/`. Still rendered as horizontal rules

 * Uses standard Python markdown processing, but custom pre-processed
   to support GitHub-style fenced code blocks.

     * CSS
     * JavaScript
     * Ruby
     * Bash
     * SQL
     * JSON
     * Markdown
     * HTML/XML
     * Python
 * from "Other"
     * Clojure
     * Clojure REPL
     * Lisp
     * R
