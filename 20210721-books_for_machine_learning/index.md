[Intro to Statistical Learning][]: The friendly version of
[Elements][] has [MOOC videos][] and a 2nd edition coming soon, all
free online. Is there a better intro? Maybe using Python?

[Elements]: https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/
[MOOC videos]: https://www.r-bloggers.com/2014/09/in-depth-introduction-to-machine-learning-in-15-hours-of-expert-videos/


[Deep Learning with Python][]: The creator of [Keras][] provides
pretty good explanations and code, as I recall. Is there a better
intro? Maybe something using [PyTorch][]?

[Keras]: https://keras.io/
[Deep Learning with Python]: https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python
[PyTorch]: https://pytorch.org/


[Statistical Rethinking][] has great explanations, examples, and
philosophical commentary for understanding Bayesian approaches.

[Mining of Massive Datasets][] is much better than its cover, with
good coverage of both more and less commonly discussed techniques (and
a [MOOC][]).
