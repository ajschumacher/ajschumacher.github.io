<h1>How to Lie with Statistics, by Huff</h1>
<p class="date">Monday April  5, 2021</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darrell_Huff">Darrell Huff</a> and his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Lie_with_Statistics">popular 1954 book</a> have <a href="/20210330-how_to_make_the_world_add_up_by_harford/">received</a>
criticism. Huff was wrong about cigarettes and cancer, but he did warn
us that people are biased. In 142 breezy pages, the book manages to
cover quite a lot, with perhaps moderate levels of prejudice for its
time.</p>

<ul>
<li>Chapter 1: “The Sample with the Built-in Bias” (sampling)</li>
<li>Chapter 2: “The Well-Chosen Average” (mean vs. median)</li>
<li>Chapter 3: “The Little Figures That Are Not There” (variance etc.)</li>
<li>Chapter 4: “Much Ado about Practically Nothing” (small differences and measurement uncertainty)</li>
<li>Chapter 5: “The Gee-Whiz Graph” (funny y-axes)</li>
<li>Chapter 6: “The One-Dimensional Picture” (dimensional distortion of comparisons)</li>
<li>Chapter 7: “The Semiattached Figure” (non-sequitur logic)</li>
<li>Chapter 8: “Post Hoc Rides Again” (correlation ≠ causation)</li>
<li>Chapter 9: “How to Statistculate” (“statistically
   manipulate”—nonsense math)</li>
<li>Chapter 10: “How to Talk Back to a Statistic” (ask questions)<ul>
<li>“Who says so?”</li>
<li>“How does he know?”</li>
<li>“What’s missing?”</li>
<li>“Did somebody change the subject?”</li>

<blockquote>
<p>"There are at least three levels of sampling involved. Dr. Kinsey's
samples of the population (one level) are far from random ones and
may not be particularly representative, but they are enormous
samples by comparison with anything done in his field before and his
figures must be accepted as revealing and important if not
necessarily on the nose. It is possibly more important to remember
that any questionnaire is only a sample (another level) of the
possible questions and that the answer the lady gives is no more
than a sample (third level) of her attitudes and experiences on each
question." (page 23)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Some of the strongest feeling against public-opinion polls is found
in liberal or left-wing circles, where it is rather commonly
believed that polls are generally rigged. Behind this view is the
fact that poll results so often fail to square with the opinions and
desires of those whose thinking is not in the conservative
direction. Polls, they point out, seem to elect Republicans even
when voters shortly thereafter do otherwise." (page 26)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interesting historical perspective; modern concerns about polls are
not necessarily new issues.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"You will also learn if you read back into the tables that the
figure is based on a sample of such size that there are nineteen
chances out of twenty that the estimate—$3,107 before it was
rounded—is correct within a margin of $59 plus or minus." (pages
35-36)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t know a confidence interval technique that will give you quite
that interpretation; this could be erroneous.</p>
<hr />
<p>"Degree of significance" (p-value) is presented on page 42 as a thing
that is usually hidden from the public, which may have been (and may
still often be) the case. These days I hear more about problems with
significance tests than demands for them.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"It is dangerous to mention any subject having high emotional
content without hastily saying where you are for or agin it." (page
46, amusing spelling in original)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procrustes">Procrustean</a> Statistic" (graphic page 43)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"In somewhat the same fashion those little figures
[reporting variance] that are missing from what are called
“Gessell’s norms” have produced pain in papas and mamas. Let a
parent read, as many have done in such places as Sunday rotogravure
sections, that “a child” learns to sit erect at the age of so many
months and he thinks at once of his own child. Let his child fail to
sit by the specified age and the parent must conclude that his
offspring is “retarded” or “subnormal” or something equally
invidious. Since half the children are bound to fail to sit by the
time mentioned, a good many parents are made unhappy. Of course,
speaking mathematically, this happiness is balanced by the joy of
the other fifty per cent of parents in discovering that their
children are “advanced.” But harm can come of the efforts of the
unhappy parents to force their children to conform to the norms and
thus be backward no longer." (pages 44-45)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"<em>Newsweek</em> once showed how “U. S. Old Folks Grow Older” by means of
a chart on which appeared two male figures, one representing the
68.2-year life expectancy of today, the other the 34-year life
expectancy of 1879-1889.'"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here Huff is complaining that the person twice as tall appears 8 times
as massive, but there are other issues with interpreting
<a href="/20200806-life_expectancy_is_historically_misleading/">historical life expectancy</a>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Who knows what germ causes colds, particularly since it probably
isn’t a germ at all?" (page 75)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What does he think causes colds? They knew about viruses in the 50s,
didn’t they?</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Let us say that during a period in which race prejudice is growing
you are employed to “prove” otherwise. It is not a difficult
assignment. Set up a poll or, better yet, have the polling done for
you by an organization of good reputation. Ask that usual cross
section of the population if they think blacks have as good a chance
as white people to get jobs. Repeat your polling at intervals so
that you will have a trend to report.</p>
<p>"Princeton’s Office of Public Opinion Research tested this question
once. What turned up is interesting that things, especially in
opinion polls, are not always what they seem. Each person who was
asked the question about jobs was also asked some questions designed
to discover if he was strongly prejudiced against blacks. It turned
out that people most strongly prejudiced were most likely to answer
Yes to the question about job opportunities. (It worked out that
about two-thirds of those who were sympathetic toward blacks did not
think the black had as good a chance at a job as a white person did,
and about two-thirds of those showing prejudice said that blacks
were getting as good breaks as whites.) It was pretty evident that
from this poll you would learn very little about employment
conditions for blacks, although you might learn some interesting
things about a man’s racial attitudes." (pages 75-76)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A couple striking dehumanizing "blacks" vs. "white people" phrasings
here. The reportage of veiled (?) racism in survey responses still
seems relevant today.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"A civilian population includes infants, the old, and the ill, all
of whom have a higher death rate wherever they are." (page 85)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s incidental to the point of the text here, but it’s interesting to
see a reference to infants having a high death rate. I think this
sounds out of place, today. When Huff was born in 1913, something like
ten percent of babies died before age five.

<blockquote>
<p>"Keep in mind that a correlation may be real and based on real cause
and effect—and still be almost worthless in determining action in
any single case." (page 93)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I read this as pointing to variability. Was he already thinking about
smoking?</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"But arbitrarily rejecting statistical methods makes no sense
either. That is like refusing to read because writers sometimes use
words to hide facts and relationships rather than to reveal them."
(page 121)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"I’ll face up to the serious purpose that I like to think lurks just
beneath the surface of this book: explaining how to look a phony
statistic in the eye and face it down; and no less important, how to
recognize sound and usable data in that wilderness of fraud to which
the previous chapters have been largely devoted." (page 122)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"You may be familiar with the Rudolf Flesch readability formula. It
purports to measure how easy a piece of prose is to read, by such
simple and objective items as length of words and sentences. Like
all devices for reducing the imponderable to a number and
substituting arithmetic for judgment, it is an appealing idea."
(page 137)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m interested in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_tests">readability stuff</a>, but it also strikes me
that the last sentence there is quite a good joke:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Like all devices for reducing the imponderable to a number and
substituting arithmetic for judgment, it is an appealing idea."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That could be an epigraph!</p>    </article>
