# How to Lie with Statistics, by Huff

[Darrell Huff][] and his [popular 1954 book][] have [received][]
criticism. Huff was wrong about cigarettes and cancer, but he did warn
us that people are biased. In 142 breezy pages, the book manages to
cover quite a lot, with perhaps moderate levels of prejudice for its
time.

Interesting historical perspective; modern concerns about polls are
not necessarily new issues.

I don’t know a confidence interval technique that will give you quite
that interpretation; this could be erroneous.

"Degree of significance" (p-value) is presented on page 42 as a thing
that is usually hidden from the public, which may have been (and may
still often be) the case. These days I hear more about problems with
significance tests than demands for them.

Here Huff is complaining that the person twice as tall appears 8 times
as massive, but there are other issues with interpreting
[historical life expectancy][]...

What does he think causes colds? They knew about viruses in the 50s,
didn’t they?

A couple striking dehumanizing "blacks" vs. "white people" phrasings
here. The reportage of veiled (?) racism in survey responses still
seems relevant today.

It’s incidental to the point of the text here, but it’s interesting to
see a reference to infants having a high death rate. I think this
sounds out of place, today. When Huff was born in 1913, something like
ten percent of babies died before age five.

I read this as pointing to variability. Was he already thinking about
smoking?

I’m interested in the [readability stuff][], but it also strikes me
that the last sentence there is quite a good joke:

That could be an epigraph!
