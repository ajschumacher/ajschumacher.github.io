<h1>How to Live on 24 Hours a Day, by Bennett</h1>
<p class="date">Saturday November  7, 2020</p>
<p>I've recommended this 1908 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Live_on_24_Hours_a_Day">book</a> since <a href="/2010/07/31/thoughts-on-tinkering-toward-utopia/">2010</a>/<a href="/20160320-books_for_professionals/">2011</a>, and I
thought I'd revisit it. The sexist language makes it hard to continue
recommending; I'd love to see a modern version.</p>
<p>The main message I take from this reading is the need to slow down,
when trying to do more. Reflect. Think. It's not packing as much as
possible into the time you have, it's getting as much as you can out.
As with eating, the good life isn't just quantity per time.</p>
<p>I relate aspects of this book to more recent <a href="https://vasilishynkarenka.com/learning/">ideas</a> about
<a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn">learning</a> and memory, which I also think are good. Many of the
charming aspects of the book relate to the <em>why</em> more than the <em>how</em>
of learning, and try to encourage the reader to believe that they
<em>can</em> find the time to do more. (A modern version might reference
statistics on <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/people-are-spending-most-of-their-waking-hours-staring-at-screens-2018-08-01">screen-watching</a>, and find that people have a lot of
time that might be better spent.)</p>
<p>Taken mildly, Bennett's advice is to get a hobby, to develop an
interest, aligned with "cultivation of the mind." Taken more
seriously, he encourages more purposeful, joyful, and "examined" life.
I can get behind both sentiments.</p>

<p>"One loses, in the study of cause and effect, that absurd air which
so many people have of being always shocked and pained by the
curiousness of life. Such people live amid human nature as if human
nature were a foreign country full of awful foreign customs. But,
having reached maturity, one ought surely to be ashamed of being a
stranger in a strange land!" (page 49)</p>

who read and read, and for all the good it does them they might just
as well cut bread-and-butter. They take to reading as better men

motor-car, their sole object being motion. They will tell you how
