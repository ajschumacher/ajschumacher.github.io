<h1>Drawbridge Up, by Enzensberger</h1>
<p class="date">Thursday October  1, 2020</p>
<p>This <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Drawbridge-Up-Mathematics-Cultural-Anathema/dp/156881156X">talk</a> from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Magnus_Enzensberger">the author of The Number Devil</a> is unfortunately
hard to find at a reasonable price. It's a beautiful short version of
the not uncommon sentiment that math should be more widely
appreciated.</p>
<ul>
<li>Short: Drawbridge Up, by Enzensberger</li>
<li>Medium: <a href="/20200909-mathematicians_lament_by_lockhart/">A Mathematician's Lament, by Lockhart</a></li>
<li>Long: <a href="//20200925-how_not_to_be_wrong_by_ellenberg/">How Not to Be Wrong, by Ellenberg</a></li>
</ul>
<p>At least <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Mumford">Mumford</a>'s preface is <a href="https://www.dam.brown.edu/people/mumford/beyond/education.html">available</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I am accustomed, as a professional mathematician, to living in a
sort of vacuum, surrounded by people who, as in the first paragraph
of Enzensberger's essay, declare with an odd sort of pride that they
are mathematically illiterate. How astonishing to come to the
International Congress and find a distinguished poet and essayist
who analyzes this problem with such a deep understanding and
sensitivity. This is a beautiful essay and great delight for a
mathematician to read. Here the strange contradictions with which we
live are laid bare with accuracy of a dissecting microscope. He is
onto our schizophrenic world in which, with one hand, we take pride
in building an elegant world utterly divorced from the demands of
reality and, with the other, claim that our ideas underlie virtually
all technological developments of significance. I was particularly
pleased to find that he believes progress is possible in teaching
mathematics, that it can be made exciting to young minds. I tried
(unsuccessfully) to get each high school in which my children were
enrolled to go outside during geometry class and find out how tall
the oak in the yard really is. Instead they buckled under to the
establishment and even removed that staple of my generation: the odd
formulaic Euclidean-style proof in which the pedigree of each step
was detailed. This old game, the one piece of high school
mathematics often mentioned warmly by people who otherwise hated
math, had been found wanting by the mathematical puritans described
in the Stewart quote, where the mathematician is unwilling to "lie a
bit, like everyone else does". I hope the right people read this
essay -- the movers and shakers of school curricula -- and that it
moves them to let a hundred flowers bloom in the classroom."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"We know that ignorance is a cosmic force of truly insuperable
power." (page 21)</p>

<p>"The unforeseen utility of mathematical models is somewhat
puzzling." (page 27)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"The ancient debate among the Platonists, the Formalists and the
Constructivists appears to be petering out into an exhausting
stalemate. Mathematicians hardly concern themselves in their praxis
with such questions." (page 29</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"It seems a pedagogical <em>id√©e fixe</em> that children are incapable of
abstract thinking." (page 37)</p>
