<h1>Game Changer, by Solomon and Blumberg</h1>
<p class="date">Sunday November  8, 2020</p>
<p>I picked this up because of the subtitle, "How to be 10x in the talent
economy." I'm interested in human <a href="https://github.com/ajschumacher/ajschumacher.github.io/issues/174">differences in productivity</a>. The
<a href="https://www.harpercollinsleadership.com/game-changer/">book</a> had little to say on the technical side, but emphasized
balancing "hard" and "soft" skills, with a big focus on continual
improvement via feedback and coaching. The book is largely an
advertisement for the authors' businesses (10x <a href="https://www.10xmanagement.com/">management</a> /
<a href="https://10xascend.com/">ascend</a>) and I think fairly effective as such.</p>
<p>I've worked in a couple companies with variations on the theme of
having a "career manager" and a "project manager," sometimes the same
person, which can engender conflicts of interest. Solomon and
Blumberg's talent management model essentially outsources your career
management to an independent firm, which is interesting. It could be
viewed as a kind of <a href="https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/matrix-organization-structure-reason-evolution-1837">matrixing</a> that extends beyond company borders.</p>
<p>Another way of viewing it is as starting your own consultancy but
outsourcing lead generation (and some other functions, like contracts)
to Solomon and Blumberg. That removes a major difficulty of going it
alone, if it works well. There are still trade-offs associated with
working 1099 vs. W-2 jobs; better health insurance options etc. would
still help more people make the leap toward greater independence from
corporations.</p>

<p>The authors give a quantitative example early on to make "10x" real:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Two weeks later, Nicole returned to our office with the news that
she had let go of no less than thirty-three of her thirty-six-person
team. <em>More than 90 percent.</em> She was sorry to lay off that many
fine workers and was quick to mention that they were well taken care
of, but there was no way around this one simple fact: Our three
recommended 10xers could deliver a better, stronger, more
sustainable product than thirty-three or even a hundred engineers
who were just "very good."" (page xiv)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's some interesting conversation to be had about labor relations,
the future of work, and what direction we really want to move in, I
think.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"In the new talent economy, everybody you deal with better be 10x,
or at least striving to be." (page xiv)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Great talent becomes 10x when it develops the quality of
<em>manageability</em>–the ability to seek out and internalize powerful
outside guidance, built on an insatiable desire for growth and
improvement." (page xx)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"... they do it because <em>they love the doing of it</em>–it's the most
important thing you can know about 10xers." (page 6)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"... the future will see work and learning blend into one." (page
14, quoting <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/adigaskell/2019/01/02/solving-future-skills-challenges/">The Key To Solving Future Skills Challenges</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>On page 16 they reference
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/24/the-two-pizza-rule-and-the-secret-of-amazons-success">The two-pizza rule and the secret of Amazon's success</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p>They speak positively about Objectives and Key Results (<a href="https://felipecastro.com/en/okr/what-is-okr/">OKRs</a>)...
Maybe I should try those?</p>
<hr />
<p>They have a neat <a href="https://10xascend.com/calculator/">Lifestyle Calculator</a> for considering 24 different
priorities in considering a job.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"When you see a door, what do you do? Do you break it down, kick it
open? Or do you go under it, over it? I need people who consider
every possibility, who can't just look at a thing for what it
usually is. They find strategic solutions from every angle. If you
can't do that, then you're the kind of person that gets stuck, and I
don't have time to help you when you do." (page 34, quoting Jesse
Lee)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Addiction, self-sabotage, procrastination, laziness, rage, chronic
fatigue, and depression are all ways that we withhold our full
participation in the program of life that we are offered." (page 43,
quoting Charles <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Eisenstein#The_More_Beautiful_World_Our_Hearts_Know_is_Possible">Eisenstein</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Chapter 3, "Success and Sabotage–The Manageability Continuum," is
largely about growth via feedback, and hiring for people who can do
that.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"The cost of a bad hire is incalculable, and not just from a
financial perspective." (page 57)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>""I don't think you can fix a temper. For the bottom 10 percent,
sabotage is just so ingrained in their personality. And I'm not a
big fan of performance improvement plans. Ninety-five percent of the
time, they're not going to make it, and if they do make it, you're
just excusing the fact that they're not really the right person for
the job because you don't want HR to be upset. It's very unusual for
someone from that lower 10 percent or 15 percent to suddenly become
a top 10 percent. At best you can move them into the middle group
where they can contribute without getting in the way."</p>
<p>"Goldsmith is far more optimistic about the 80 percent in the
middle, those with mixed impulses. "<em>They</em> can change. I've seen
examples when great leaders have been put in place that inspire
previously unsuccessful teams and individuals."" (pages 58-59,
quoting Scott Goldsmith)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>""The biggest change was...the leader worked hard to help the
individuals on that team to <em>change their mindset.</em>"" (page 59,
quoting Scott Goldsmith)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>""I ask potential new hires one question: <em>'On a scale of one to
ten, how weird are you?'</em> And I never hire lower than a seven.""
(page 59, quoting Scott Goldsmith)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>On pages 62-63, they highlight three interview questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>How well did the potential 10xer handle a significant mistake of
   their own making?</li>
<li>How does the potential 10xer handle a situation where a boss or
   client wants something he or she thinks is a bad idea?</li>
<li>What does the potential 10xer identify as their biggest
   professional weaknesses?</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>On page 70 they talk about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johari_window">Johari window</a>.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>""In fact, I believe that in the future we're going to look back and
say that what we did before genetic engineering was barbaric and
like playing a genetic lottery on our children."" (page 125, quoting
Bryan Bishop)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The book doesn't say much of anything about genetic contributions to
being "10x" and this quote isn't intended to be related to that topic,
but the concept is sort of uncomfortably in the background somehow...</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"... once you lose the talent war, you completely limit a company's
ability to compete and excel." (page 140)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"After all, the difference between management and leadership is
huge." (page 142)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"I am humbly and strongly requesting your feedback. We have a lot of
contact on an ongoing basis and I am really focused on learning more
about my weaknesses, blind spots, or other areas that need
meaningful improvement." (page 164)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Part of some recommended language for soliciting feedback.)</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>""Talent hits a target no one else can hit. Genius hits a target no
one else can see."" (page 187, quoting Arthur Schopenhauer)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>On page 200, they talk about what they call a "L.E.A.P. doc" which is
an employment List of Expectations and Priorities, which they suggest
sending as a kind of first move in negotiating employment. An
interesting idea.</p>    </article>
