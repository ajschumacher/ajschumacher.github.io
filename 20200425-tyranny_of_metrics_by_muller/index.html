<h1>The Tyranny of Metrics, by Muller</h1>
<p class="date">Saturday April 25, 2020</p>
<p><a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691174952/the-tyranny-of-metrics" title="The Tyranny of Metrics (Princeton University Press)">The Tyranny of Metrics</a> is the book version of the author's
<a href="https://www.the-american-interest.com/2015/08/03/the-costs-of-accountability/" title="The Costs of Accountability (The American Interest)">earlier article</a>. It's a pretty good <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2013/05/31/178263/the-dictatorship-of-data/" title="The Dictatorship of Data (MIT Technology Review)">collection</a> of <a href="https://www.amstat.org/asa/files/pdfs/POL-ASAVAM-Statement.pdf" title="ASA Statement on Using Value-Added Models for Educational Assessment">concerns</a>
around measurement, focused on <a href="https://fs.blog/2018/02/unintended-consequences/" title="The Law of Unintended Consequences: Shakespeare, Cobra Breeding, and a Tower in Pisa (Farnam Street)">unintended consequences</a>.</p>
<p>One thing that <a href="https://history.catholic.edu/faculty-and-research/faculty-profiles/muller-jerry/index.html">Muller</a>'s historical perspective brought out was the
development of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_management">scientific management</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_consulting">management consulting</a>
as practices distinct from particular fields or businesses. I think
there are parallels to the development of data science.</p>
<p>He also maintains that the main value of a metric can come from
looking at outliers rather than tracking averages or otherwise using
the metric over all cases. I think this is an often neglected focus.</p>
<p>There's a lot of interesting stuff. Here are some quotes that I
thought were particularly interesting:</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Accountability ought to mean being held responsible for one's
actions. But by a sort of linguistic sleight of hand, accountability
has come to mean demonstrating success through standardized
measurement, as if only that which can be counted really counts."
(page 4)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"When proponents of metrics advocate "accountability," they tacitly
combine two meanings of the word. On the one hand, to be accountable
means to be responsible. But it can also mean "capable of being
counted."" (page 17)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"This book is not about the evils of measuring. It is about the
unintended consequences of trying to substitute standardized
measures of performance for personal judgment based on experience.
The problem is not measurement, but excessive measurement and
inappropriate measurement—not metrics, but metric fixation." (page
4)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"The key components of metric fixation are</p>
<ul>
<li>"the belief that it is possible and desirable to replace judgment,
  acquired by personal experience and talent, with numerical
  indicators of comparative performance based upon standardized data
  (metrics);</li>
<li>"the belief that making such metrics public (transparent) assures
  that institutions are actually carrying out their purposes
  (accountability);</li>
<li>"the belief that the best way to motivate people within these
  organizations is by attaching rewards and penalties to their
  measured performance, rewards that are either monetary
  (pay-for-performance) or reputational (rankings)." (page 18)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>"Recurring Flaws" from Chapter 2:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>"Measuring the most easily measurable"</li>
<li>"measuring the simple when the desired outcome is complex"</li>
<li>"Measuring inputs rather than outcomes"</li>
<li>"Degrading information quality through standardization"</li>
<li>"Gaming through creaming"</li>
<li>"Improving numbers by lowering standards"</li>
<li>"Improving numbers through omission or distortion of data"</li>
<li>"Cheating"</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Under scientific management the managers assume ... the burden of
gathering together all of the traditional knowledge which in the
past has been possessed by the workmen and then of classifying,
tabulating, and reducing this knowledge to rules, laws, formulae...
Thus all of the planning which under the old system was done by the
workmen, must of necessity under the new system be done by
management in accordance with the law of science." (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Winslow_Taylor">Taylor</a>
quoted pages 32-33)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"It is only through <em>enforced</em> standardization of methods,
<em>enforced</em> adoption of the best implements and working conditions,
and <em>enforced</em> cooperation that this faster work can be assured. And
the duty of enforcing the adoption of standards and enforcing this
cooperation rests with <em>management</em> alone." (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Winslow_Taylor">Taylor</a> quoted page
33)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"The calculative is the enemy of the imaginative." (page 61)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"This lends a certain air of unreality to the explorations of what
one might call the unworldly economists, who combine hard measures
of statistical validity with weak interest in the validity of the
units of measurement." (page 72)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>The effect of valuing quantity over quality in academic publishing
leads to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"a great stream of publications that are both uninteresting and
unread." (page 79)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"This is an instance of <em>diagnostic</em> metrics. It provides data that
can be used by a practitioner (physician), or internally within an
institution (hospital), or shared among practitioners and
institutions to discover what is working and what is not, and to use
that information to improve performance." (page 110)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"... the metrics matter because of the way they are embedded into a
larger institutional culture." (page 110)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Extrinsic rewards become an important determinant of job
satisfaction only among workers for whom intrinsic rewards are
relatively unavailable." (<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2778664" title="The Happy Worker: An Analysis of Educational and Occupational Differences in Determinants of Job Satisfaction">Gruenberg</a> quoted page 137)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"The fact that allies spy on one another to a certain degree to
determine intentions, capacities, and vulnerabilities is well known
to practitioners of government. But it cannot be publicly
acknowledged, since it represents a threat to the amour propre of
other nations." (page 164)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Chapter 15 "Unintended but predictable negative consequences":</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>"Goal displacement through diversion of effort to what gets
  measured"</li>
<li>"Promoting short-termism"</li>
<li>"Costs in employee time"</li>
<li>"Diminishing utility"</li>
<li>"Rule cascades" (to prevent gaming the metrics, etc.)</li>
<li>"Rewarding luck"</li>
<li>"Discouraging risk-taking"</li>
<li>"Discouraging innovation"</li>
<li>"Discouraging cooperation and common purpose"</li>
<li>"Degradation of work" (the experience of working people)</li>
<li>"Costs to productivity"</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Chapter 16 "When and how to use metrics":</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>"What <em>kind</em> of information are you thinking of measuring?"</li>
<li>"How <em>useful</em> is the information?"</li>
<li>"How useful are <em>more</em> metrics?"</li>
<li>"What are the costs of <em>not</em> relying upon standardized
   measurement?"</li>
<li>"To what <em>purposes</em> will the measurement be put, or to put it
   another way, to <em>whom</em> will the information be made transparent?"</li>
<li>"What are the <em>costs</em> of acquiring the metrics?"</li>
<li>"Ask why the people at the top of the organization are demanding
   performance metrics."</li>
<li>"<em>How</em> and <em>by whom</em> are the measures of performance developed?"</li>
<li>"Remember that <em>even the best measures are subject to corruption
   or goal diversion.</em>"</li>
<li>"Remember that sometimes, recognizing the limits of the possible
    is the beginning of wisdom."</li>
</ol>

<hr />
<p>Here Muller lists a factor outside the control of the American medical
system, citing page 84 of <em>In Excellent Health</em> by Atlas and a paper
on <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w14333" title="Socioeconomic Status and Health: Dimensions and Mechanisms">Socioeconomic Status and Health</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Moreover, the United States is an ethnically heterogeneous country,
and some ethnic groups (such as African Americans) have
disproportionately high rates of infant mortality, reflecting
social, cultural, and possibly genetic factors." (p. 106)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This strikes me as, at the very least, unfortunate phrasing. Here's
<a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/early-childhood/reports/2018/02/01/445576/exploring-african-americans-high-maternal-infant-death-rates/" title="Exploring African Americans’ High Maternal and Infant Death Rates">how some others talk</a> about African American infant mortality rates:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is racism, not race itself, that threatens the lives of African
American women and infants."</p>
