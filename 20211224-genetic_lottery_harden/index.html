<h1>The Genetic Lottery, by Harden</h1>
<p class="date">Friday December 24, 2021</p>
<p>Harden has something for everyone to dislike, telling the left that
environment isn't everything and telling the right that
self-determination isn't everything. I think her recommendation to use
genetic controls in statistical analysis is interesting but hard.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The biggest contribution of genetics to the social sciences is to
give researchers an additional set of tools to do basic research by
measuring and statistically controlling for a variable—DNA—that has
previously been very difficult to measure and statistically control
for." (page 192)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691190808/the-genetic-lottery" title="The Genetic Lottery: Why DNA Matters for Social Equality">The Genetic Lottery</a> has received criticism. Here's
<a href="https://www.lareviewofbooks.org/article/why-dna-is-no-key-to-social-equality-on-kathryn-paige-hardens-the-genetic-lottery" title="Why DNA Is No Key to Social Equality: On Kathryn Paige Harden’s “The Genetic Lottery”">Henn et al.</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Ultimately, [Harden's] focus on genetics as a fundamental cause of
social inequality reduces her version of social justice to
benevolent paternalism."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think Harden does a fair job of being clear that genetics can be a
cause, but certainly not the only cause, and not a cause that can't be
redressed. On “benevolent paternalism,” I think Henn et al. intend the
phrase to have negative connotation, but couldn't any attempt at
social justice (or social safety nets) be referred to in this way?</p>
<p>As in the “equality vs. equity” <a href="https://interactioninstitute.org/illustrating-equality-vs-equity/">cartoon</a> on page 162, I take it as
a given that everyone should be able to see over the fence—the hard
question is how high the fence that we're trying to get everybody over
is. What's the level that should be guaranteed, and what are
exceptions for extreme cases?</p>
<p>Bird has <a href="https://massivesci.com/articles/genetic-lottery-review-paige-harden-kevin-bird/" title="The Genetic Lottery is a bust for both genetics and policy">issues</a> with the presentation of the science, and I agree
I would have liked more detail and precision in the presentation, but
Harden is also trying to reach a broad audience and cover a lot of
material. I think Bird is incorrect in his accusation that Harden
doesn't engage with the history of eugenics.</p>
<p>Harden's point that genetic confounds can affect optimal policy
recommendations seems meaningful to me. If parents with lots of books
in their home have kids who learn to read, does that imply giving
everyone a stack of books is all we need to do?</p>
<p>I think Harden is right that if the well-intentioned don't engage with
genetics, their impact is muted by confounding while the
ill-intentioned advertise “forbidden knowledge” to the benefit of
none. But I don't expect a major shift in Harden's lifetime.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The SNPs correlated with non-cognitive skills were correlated with
<em>higher</em> risk for several mental disorders, including schizophrenia,
bipolar disorder, anorexia nervosa, and obsessive-compulsive
disorder. This result warns us against viewing the genetic variants
that are associated with going further in current systems of formal
education as being inherently “good” things. A single genetic
variant might make it a tiny bit more likely that someone will go
further in school, but that same variant might also elevate their
risk of developing schizophrenia or another serious mental
disorder." (page 144)</p>
