# The Room, by Karlsson

Karlsson's [Room][] is set in a kind of office, but more than that
it's a novel (almost a long parable) about epistemology, how people
believe in conspiracy theories, and the tragedy of modern retreats
from reality. By early reviews, the [film version][] isn't as good.

The narrator, Björn, seems to have (at least) an autism spectrum
disorder that brings to mind
[The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time][]. He also has
tons of self-importance, zero self-awareness, and a disdain for women
that all make him seem like an easy Proud Boys recruit. He describes
himself as working at an office for a non-corporate Authority but it's
easy to wonder whether it isn't really a care facility for people with
psychological difficulties. (And aren't we all limited in our ability
to know truth?)

Björn believes in, and apparently experiences, a room that none of his
colleagues at the office can see. When Björn finds that by measurement
there couldn't be a room where he thinks there is one, he concludes
that some trick must be at work as part of a conspiracy amongst the
office. A medical professional confesses to thinking that Björn is
just pretending to believe in the room—and who hasn't thought
similarly of flat-earthers?


After a confrontation at work and a tearful breakdown at home, Björn
changes. He describes himself having success at work. Is this real, or
has he inhabited his fantasies from earlier? Is he somehow really
successful, and the point is that people with strange views can
contribute to society? I lean toward the interpretation that the
narrator has become even less reliable.


As Björn becomes less and less connected with reality, his false sense
of power grows and he demands more and more, until he collides with
some aspects of office reality that he can't reinterpret. His
persecution complex runs wild and he eventually disappears completely
into his alternate reality. His isolation, once partial, is total.

He doesn't understand context, doesn't think there's any purpose or
measure other than his own.

Irony via anosognosia.

Almost a Tyler Durden vibe?

This is one of at least two times that Björn is oblivious of his turn
to introduce himself.


---

> “I’d say that you’re putting it on.” (page 98)

This is the frustrated final comment from the medical assessor who
decides Björn doesn't need anything from a psychiatrist.


---

> “I think you maximize your potential better if you imagine a

Björn is thinking of himself as a business, focused on performance and
success in terms of exchange. This may be partly his autistic bent,
but also partly a critique of some modern attitudes toward work and
success. “You are a brand” etc.

This is someone asking how they can tell, if Björn is acting as if
he's believing in the room, they can tell whether he's actually
believing in the room or just acting that way.

Some fun epistemology talk... I can't help but wonder whether Karl
(the manager) is supposed to bring to mind Karl Popper.

Björn is referring to the conspiracy of everyone else pretending there
isn't a room.


---

That's Karl the manager speaking, and the DG is the Director General,
who is at least the local "authority" of The Authority.


---

> This was really just a classic ruling-class tactic, wasn’t it?
> Making someone think they were mentally ill? (page 184)

Björn continues to think everybody's gaslighting him.

> wall closed around me, like yogurt around a spoon. (page 185)

This is right at the end; Björn's final hiding place, free from the
complexity of other people and the rest of the real world, "No angles
or corners for dirt to get into and hide." His retreat from reality is
complete.
