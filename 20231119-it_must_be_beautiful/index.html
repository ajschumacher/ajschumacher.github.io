<h1>It must be beautiful, edited by Farmelo</h1>
<p class="date">Sunday November 19, 2023</p>
<p>This is a nice collection of essays about some beautiful equations,
edited by the author of <a href="/20230816-strangest_man_by_farmelo/" title="The Strangest Man, by Farmelo">a biography of Dirac</a>. Not every equation
is fully explained, but there's great history and big-picture
explanation. The authors are frequently major contributors to the
fields.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Planck-Einstein Equation for the Energy of a Quantum: \( E = hf\)</li>
<li>The Logistic Map: \( x_{next} = a x_{initial} (1 - x_{initial}) \)</li>
<li>The Drake Equation: \( N = R^* \cdot f_p \cdot n_e \cdot f_l \cdot f_i \cdot f_c \cdot L \)</li>
<li>\( E = m c^2 \)</li>
<li>The Molina-Rowland Chemical Equations<ul>
<li>\( CFCl_3 \rightarrow CFCl_2 + Cl \)</li>

<blockquote>
<p>"It was in large part thanks to this [logistic map] equation, one so
simple that children can study it at school, that scientists in the
1970s came to see that some equations that appear to predict the
future in terms of the past are completely unable to make such
predictions, contrary to what most scientists had thought." (page
xvii)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe children <em>should</em> study it at school, if they're not,
currently...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The [wave-particle] problem's resolution came in the late 1920s,
when physicists developed quantum theory into what became known as
quantum field theory, which made possible a unified description of
radiation and matter." (page 24)</p>

<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Avoiding detailed assumptions about this or that feature of the way
particular objects were built or interacted, Einstein's theory
hardly resembled the work of senior physicists of the time. Instead,
it had an outsider's style—or perhaps a return to an older form of
clarity." (page 75)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The sense of aesthetics that Shcrödinger alludes to here is his
preference for a mathematics that is more familiar and also not as
ugly as Heisenberg's 'transcendental algebra' (or matrices), but
which also permits visualizability of atomic processes." (page 117)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Transcendental algebra?</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"In the pantheon of twentieth-century physics, Heisenberg is second
only to Einstein." (page 129)</p>

<p>Feel like somebody told me that was <a href="/20230816-strangest_man_by_farmelo/" title="The Strangest Man, by Farmelo">Dirac</a>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"As the physicist who did more to delve into the foundations of
quantum theory than anyone else since Bohr, Einstein and Heisenberg,
John Bell, once put it, 'for all practical purposes' quantum
mechanics works well. He forcefully reminded us, however, that we
still do not fully understand the Schrödinger equation." (page 131)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Is it really possible, by logical processing or calculation, to
arrive at essentially new insights—to get out more than you put in?</p>
<p>"This question is especially timely today, since it lies at the
heart of debates regarding the nature of machine
intelligence—whether it may develop into a species of mind on a par
with human intelligence, or even its eventual superior." (pages
155-156)</p>

<p>This was in <em>2002.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"They [Dirac, Maxwell, Einstein] proceed by <em>experimental logic.</em>
That concept is an oxymoron only on the surface. In experimental
logic, one formulates hypotheses in equations, and experiments with
those equations. That is, one tries to improve the equations from
the point of view of beauty and consistency, and then checks whether
the 'improved' equations elucidate some feature of nature.
Mathematicians recognize the technique of 'proof by contradiction':
to prove <em>A,</em> you assume the opposite of <em>A,</em> and reach a
contradiction. Experimental logic is 'validation by fruitfulness':
to validate <em>A,</em> assume it, and show that it leads to fruitful
consequences. Relative to routine deductive logic, experimental
logic abides by the Jesuit credo: 'It is more blessed to ask
forgiveness than permission.'" (page 159)</p>
<p>"Creative mathematics and physics rely not on perfect logic, but
rather on an experimental logic. Experimental logic involves
noticing patterns, playing with them, making assumptions to explain
them, and—especially—recognizing beauty."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Abduction? With guess-and-check? And aesthetics?</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"As the anthropologists Robert Boyd and Peter Richerson once
remarked, ‘To replace a world you do not understand by a model of
the world you do not understand is no advance.’" (page 165)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>"There are questions that are too hard to think about without the
aid of mathematics." (page 179)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>In fact, in the four dimensions of space-time, there are <em>twenty</em>
independent components to the curvature, and these can be collected
together to describe a mathematical entity referred to as the
'Rieman curvature tensor'. (page 191)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"In 1918, the young German mathematician Emmy Noether discovered a
deeply fundamental relationship between symmetry and the
conservation of physical quantities, such as electric charge. She
found that for every conserved quantity there is a related
symmetry—and vice versa." (page 236)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"In an essay on 'Beauty and theoretical physics,' Yang quotes
Heisenberg as saying in 1973, 'We will have to abandon the
philosophy of Democritus and the concept of elementary particles. We
should accept instead the concept of fundamental symmetries.'" (page
251)</p>

<p>Dirac has a paper called "Pretty mathematics."</p>
