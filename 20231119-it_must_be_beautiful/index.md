# It must be beautiful, edited by Farmelo

This is a nice collection of essays about some beautiful equations,
edited by the author of [a biography of Dirac][]. Not every equation
is fully explained, but there's great history and big-picture
explanation. The authors are frequently major contributors to the
fields.

1. The Planck-Einstein Equation for the Energy of a Quantum: \\( E = hf\\)
2. The Logistic Map: \\( x_{next} = a x_{initial} (1 - x_{initial}) \\)
3. The Drake Equation: \\( N = R^* \cdot f_p \cdot n_e \cdot f_l \cdot f_i \cdot f_c \cdot L \\)
4. \\( E = m c^2 \\)
5. The Molina-Rowland Chemical Equations
    * \\( CFCl_3 \rightarrow CFCl_2 + Cl \\)
    * \\( Cl + O_3 \rightarrow ClO + O_2 \\)
    * \\( ClO + O \rightarrow Cl + O_2\\)
6. Schrödinger's Wave Equation: \\( \hat{H} \psi = E \psi \\)
7. The Dirac Equation: \\( \left[ \gamma^\mu \left( i \frac{\partial}{\partial x^\mu} - e A_\mu (x) \right) + m \right] \psi (x) = 0 \\)
8. Evolutionarily Stable Strategy: \\( E(S, S) > E(T, S) \\)
9. The Einstein Equation of General Relativity: \\( R_{ab} - \frac{1}{2}Rg_{ab} = -8\pi G T_{ab} \\)
10. Shannon's Equations
    * \\( I = -p \log_2 p \\)
    * \\( C = W \log_2 (1 + S/N) \\)
11. The Yang-Mills Equation: \\( \partial \mathbf{f}_{μν} / \partial x_ν + 2 \varepsilon (\mathbf{b}_ν \cdot \mathbf{f}\_{μν}) + \mathbf{J}_μ = 0 \\)

Maybe children _should_ study it at school, if they're not,
currently...

[Period three implies chaos][] is one of the best paper names of all
time.

Transcendental algebra?

Feel like somebody told me that was [Dirac][]...

The citation here is [Against 'measurement'][], which is straight FIRE.

This was in _2002._

Abduction? With guess-and-check? And aesthetics?

Dirac has a paper called "Pretty mathematics."

Something about the Einstein summation convention...
