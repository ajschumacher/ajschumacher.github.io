As a former physics undergraduate student, I was excited to see if the
ugly Copenhagen interpretation had finally been retired. Becker gave
me some hope but in the end it looks like people are still mostly
shutting up and calculating. I still like the “what is real” framing,
even if the [book][] can't completely deliver.

[book]: https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/adam-becker/what-is-real/9781541698970/


A few thoughts:

 * One of the unique things about quantum physics is its ontic
   randomness. Even just skimming some of the book's references, like
   [Born][] and [Hermann][], it's clear people were wrestling with
   this a lot. But the author sort of puts it out of scope.
 * How, in a book on what is real, do you come so close as to discuss
   Quine's [Two Dogmas][] but not dive into the myth of physical
   objects? (To be clear, there is discussion of scientific realism,
   but this aspect of it isn't much explored, as I recall.)
 * Similarly, there isn't much discussion of what we really think
   exists. Pointlike particles? (In what sense does anybody believe in
   them?) Discrete space? Something else? In what may be a bit of
   humor, the very last note at the end of the book is about how many
   interpretations don't, in fact, believe in "particles" as such at
   all.
 * I would have liked for there to be more on [map vs. territory][] as
   it pertains to what is real. Where do we think the theory is "real"
   vs. where is it just a model? (There is some discussion of
   epistemic vs. ontic interpretations, though this could have been
   clearer too. I think this connects to
   [Unreasonable Effectiveness][], which also would have been
   interesting to see explored more.
 * Another connection that seems interesting is the mathematical idea
   of model theory, where you differentiate between a formal system
   and a model that satisfies it. With multiple interpretations that
   don't seem to have different predictions than "standard quantum
   physics" the interpretations start to feel like models in this
   sense.
 * It would have been nice to get more/clearer on Heisenberg's
   uncertainty principle. Looking into it more myself, I got as far as
   an interesting hint that you can understand it as position and
   momentum wave functions being mutually Fourier transforms, so if
   one is narrow the other is spread out.
 * In general, the author seemed sometimes to assume knowledge instead
   of clearly laying out enough to get up to speed. Part of this is
   probably just trying to avoid technicality that would put people
   off. To illustrate: DeWitt's [Quantum Mechanics and Reality][] is
   great (and very approximately a short version of the whole book)
   but it has enough math notation in it that it probably puts off a
   lot of people who would otherwise read and enjoy it. (And it's
   trying to be gentle itself.) But if you don't explain spin or
   polarization (etc.) at all, people will also be left out. And when
   interpretation is largely about putting meaning to the math, it's
   hard to think about if you never see the math.
 * What kinds of things are eligible to constitute an interpretation?
   The math alone seems not to be. Do things have to reduce to
   [naïve physics][] in order to be part of an interpretation? Is any
   (non-mathematical) abstraction acceptable? Must it satisfy some
   assumptions? (Some might have put locality in that bucket,
   previously?)

What is the Copenhagen interpretation?

 * divide quantum vs. classical scales (vague)
 * wave function collapse on observation (measurement problem)
 * no hidden variables (it's not just that we don't know the state
   yet)
 * says nothing about the world (?)
 * wave-particle duality ("complementarity")


Other interpretations:

 * Bohm pilot-wave
 * multiple worlds
 * superdeterminism
 * spontaneous collapse


In the end, I still don't understand all of physics. Magnets are
weird. Light is weird. Gravity is weird. Becker has more to say
tearing down Copenhagen than in building any particular replacement;
as in the subtitle, the quest is unfinished. Excelsior?

This alone is not such a big deal. Different models apply to different
views, scales, etc. Statistical Mechanics doesn't apply to individual
particles, for example. It is weird if you treat the divide as
fundamental, but if you treat it as a matter of convenience or
approximation, I don't have a problem with it.

The heart of the Copenhagen weirdness is the measurement problem as in
Schrödinger's cat: denying decided existence until we look.

This isn't about the Copenhagen interpretation, is it? This is about
hidden variables? (No-hidden-variables isn't what we mean by
Copenhagen, is it? I thought everybody agreed about no hidden
variables...)

This is fairly bad for the big structure of the book, which hinges on
the "proof of the Copenhagen interpretation" coming undone.

Coming back to this later: Maybe no-hidden-variables is/was part of
the Copenhagen interpretation? It seems like the author argues the
pilot-wave interpretation has hidden variables (but not locality) and
that shows von Neumann was wrong. But still, Born was talking about
determinism, and hidden variables also isn't the same thing as
determinism...

Is this quite fair? Doesn't it say the cat is both alive and dead?
It's a weird thing to say, but it seems to say it...

This is a little bit like calling a line an infinite collection of

Is there a problem in treating the wave function as describing our
state of knowledge? We don't have any problem with making
probabilistic predictions, for example, and then when we get data we
switch from the probabilistic prediction to the observed data. How
different is the quantum wave function really?

(I think there _is_ a problem in thinking about it this way, and it
would have been nice for the author to make this clearer... For
example, if the wave function is 50% along two paths, they shouldn't
interfere with one another if the wave function is just a description
of our knowledge.)

At some point we really can't say anything about the "underlying
reality" of what we observe. Is quantum mechanics that boundary?

(No.)

Map and territory... How different is it to have absolute space be

This is silly. Nothing is _directly_ observable in principle, and yet
we believe in chairs, other people, etc.

If he's _really_ positivist, how does he believe in anything other
than claims about sense perceptions? "I see a chair" doesn't imply "I
believe there is a chair."

This is a standard bad take. Even if there's some historicity to it,
in how Heisenberg was thinking, it's misleading to make uncertainty
seem like it's about physicality of measurement.

This is in a part about how the militarization of physics made it less

shutting up and calculating...

Also kind of weird to have students write essays on the role of the

The difference between an answer being there but we can't know it,
versus there not being an answer apart from our attempt to know it.

Neat! Seems to suggest that wave functions have some sort of "reality"
to them even when their real component is zero?

This doesn't solve the measurement problem! This makes measurement
central to the evolution of the universe(s), which is just as bad if
not worse!

And measurements don't have just simple binary outcomes; infinite
position outcomes (or nearly so, if we go to the nearest Planck
length) are possible, etc.

So we say the wave function doesn't collapse. In some sense the wave
function _is_ the "multi-verse," then, and the "many worlds" aren't
really many but just aspects of the wave function multi-verse...

Coming back later: The book doesn't do it, but I am now suspecting
that there is some better definition of "quantum event" in terms of
when the wave function becomes decoherent or something... In
multi-worlds the wave function is sometimes behaving weirdly quantum,
interfering with itself and so on, and sometimes things settle into a
"branch" where one thing seems to have happened.

But: some people still [don't think][] decoherence solves the
measurement problem.

of work to get Bohr on board with ideas Bohr doesn't like. (around
page 130)

Also: Funny when DeWitt later says Wheeler is a backer of multiple
worlds.

On page 145 the author does clarify that von Neumann's proof
(mentioned page 9) was purporting to show the impossibility of
hidden-variable interpretations. I still think this is quite a bit
more specific than "the Copenhagen interpretation"... Bohm's theory is
given as an example of one with hidden variables that does work.

Wikipedia's [Quantum contextuality][] notes that "Nonlocality, in the
sense of Bell's theorem, may be viewed as a special case of the more
general phenomenon of contextuality".

The author is at pains to explain that "realism" is not a distinct
assumption that could be false, though I think I've seen this
explained differently...

Superdeterminism is also mentioned but dismissed.

Books don't exist.

When I think I have a book in my hand I believe that in addition to my
conception of the book there is some "real thing" that is the book. I
believe that my sensation of holding the book is because of that real
thing. But I can't _directly_ perceive that thing. I see light from
the book, I feel pressure from the book on my fingers.

Sense perception of many things is indirect. I've never been on the
dark side of the moon, but I believe it has a "real thing" existence
like a book.

This extends to electrons. They are not less real than anything else.
Other things aren't more real than them.

Why (and how?) make a distinction between things that are part of
"naïve physics" and things that are part of more sophisticated models?
They're all models, all map, none of them territory.

[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Dogmas_of_Empiricism


Quine spends more time on the analytic-synthetic distinction than on
reductionism ("the verification theory of meaning").

On the analytic-synthetic distinction, I think Quine is pointing out
problems with human language, not proving the non-distinction he aims
to prove. Certainly mathematical tautologies are analytic.

It is indeed hard to talk about the world though (synthetic). From the wiki:

I like this "myth of physical objects;" maybe that's a helpful phrase
for thinking about things. As in the discussion of books and electrons
above: which myths do you think are useful? Which do you really
believe? Is it helpful to "really believe" in those things in Plato's
realm of ideals?

What do I think? I think it's asking too much to believe in
everything. Maybe I can call my point of view “deep agnosticism,” in
which nothing is officially believed, though of course you can't walk
around without having some beliefs in practice. _Something_ is going
on. Hard to say exactly what. But that doesn't have to stop us living
with chairs and books and electrons.

First, "bears no relation at all to the actual stuff in the world" is
not the same as "is the same as the actual stuff in the world."
Electrons can be a useful thing to act as if is real, regardless of
whether electrons "exist" in a physical sense or we're in a simulation
that's programmed as if there are electrons.

Astonishingly lucky? Unreasonably lucky? This reminds me of The
Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences,
which is not so different: We make models, and the models work really
well.

Maybe one of them is this "[Quantum mysteries for anyone][]" which
features the example that our author presents as variations on
roulette wheels. (Credit is given, in a note on page 333.) It's nice that at the end Mermin explains a real
possible realization of the apparatus.

The reference is Wheeler and Zurek's 1983 _Quantum Theory and
Measurement,_ page 188.

Wheeler says, in his chapter called "Law without Law":

It isn't super clear to me that this ties directly to Bell
experiments, but I didn't look at the Wheeler book for long. And
didn't everybody agree that (non-probabilistic) determinism was out
anyway? Doesn't seem like you need Bell for that.

On information specifically, I'm reminded of my old buddy [Kantor][],
whose work I've still never really understood.

But overall yes, I agree with Bell here.

Let's read that article.

This is very funny, as the "more complicated piece of apparatus" is a
person: he's alluding to consciousness, but obliquely. (He gets to it
shortly.)

"Measurementlike" is key, and possibly confusing. Maybe "decoherent"
would be better?

This was the bit that made me start to think I understood better what
decoherence means, and why the splitting of many worlds doesn't
necessarily have the observer problem any more.

I like some of [Deutsch's stuff], but I hadn't been on board re: many
worlds, before. Maybe I'm getting convinced?

[Deutsch's stuff]: /20220410-beginning_of_infinity_by_deutsch/


Something interesting happens then, doesn't it? Quantum mechanics is
indeed ontologically random, at the lowest level, and the wave
function captures that. But as we look backward in time, it's
epistemic from the point of view of the evolution of our specific
world vantage point. Before we start a Schrödinger's cat experiment,
we predict 50/50 odds and that's really true, there's an irreducible
randomness. After running the experiment, however, the wave function
describes our state of knowledge but not the reality. The cat really
is alive or dead and not both, in the world path that we're really in.

And that's how it always is, isn't it? Predictions forward, knowledge
backward...

I'm not sure it's even clear what "literally real" means here... It
seems clear they're not like islands in the sea, independent entities
that you can skip between. More like aspects of the wave function than
like separate wave functions, right?

(Everett's many-worlds interpretation was also called "relative-state.")

Yikes! Who hurt you?

Unavoidably? I think this is an exaggerated claim. I think maybe we've
done a poor job in organizing and explaining the knowledge we (should)
have. Not to mention all the people who seem to get a lot of education
and still come out knowing basically nothing.

A contributing factor might be the allegedly unopinionated kitchen
sink nature of curricula, where the view is wide and often historical
even when the knowledge isn't fundamentally historical in nature.

I agree with this; it seems generous to even call Copenhagen an
interpretation.

Oh! And in this note (page 340) there's a quote from Bas van Fraassen:
