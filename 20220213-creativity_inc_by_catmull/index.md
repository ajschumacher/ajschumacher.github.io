# Creativity, Inc., by Catmull

[Catmull][] says it's not a memoir, but of course it is, too, and
that's a good thing. I like his focus on getting fear out of
organizations and making it possible to do things, to try things,
without having rigid plans in advance. Pretty good advice throughout,
I think.

Catmull reminds me of the Montessori idea of a prepared environment,
when for example he discusses the effect of a particular table on his
team (page 5).

He discusses fear about hiring someone smarter than him, which seems
sort of weird to me (page 23). Am I scared to hire someone smarter
than me? It's always hard to tell relative smartness, of course, but I
think in general I've been very happy, the smarter the person.

Reminds me of "gelling" (as in [Peopleware][]).

I like this image a lot. I think it connects to a lot of
learning/education.

The book closes with a section called "Starting points," which is five
pages of short statements, almost aphorisms, that highlight major
ideas from the book. Handles, maybe.

This is interesting to me in relation to the question of whether math
is discovered or created. Surely a story is created, but this connects
to the process as being about externalizing and evaluating, connects
to [no ideas but in things][].

Is this what managing up means? I've always thought of it as a more
positive thing, where an IC is helping guide their manager and the
organization as much as the manager guides the IC, reciprocally. But
it seems some people think of "managing up" as a negative thing?
