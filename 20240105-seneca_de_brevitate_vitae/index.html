<h1>Seneca's De Brevitate Vitae</h1>
<p class="date">Friday January  5, 2024</p>
<p>I guess it's just an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Brevitate_Vitae_(Seneca)" title="Wikipedia: De Brevitate Vitae (Seneca)">essay</a>, but I spent a dollar and highlighted a
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B084QKS7PG/" title="Amazon: On the Shortness of Life Kindle Edition">Kindle version</a> of On the Shortness of Life, so I'm probably making
the most of mine. It's a little bit like a much earlier version of
<a href="/20201107-how_to_live_on_24_hours_a_day/" title="How to Live on 24 Hours a Day, by Bennett">How to Live on 24 Hours a Day</a>, except that it's quite specific in
what you <em>should</em> be doing with your life: philosophy. Okay, senator.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of all men they alone are at leisure who take time for philosophy,
they alone really live; for they are not content to be good
guardians of their own lifetime only.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>It is not that we have a short space of time, but that we waste much
of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>the life we receive is not short, but we make it so,</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Everyone hurries his life on and suffers from a yearning for the
future and a weariness of the present.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Men trifle with the most precious thing in the world; but they are
blind to it because it is an incorporeal thing, because it does not
come beneath the sight of the eyes, and for this reason it is
counted a very cheap thingâ€”nay, of almost no value at all.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>busy men find life very short.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>so enfeebled are they by the excessive lassitude of a pampered mind
that they cannot find out by themselves whether they are hungry!</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>it seems the part of a man who is very lowly and despicable to know
what he is doing.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>They annex every age to their own; all the years that have gone
before them are an addition to their store.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Has some time passed by? This he embraces by recollection. Is time
present? This he uses. Is it still to come? This he anticipates. He
makes his life long by combining all times into one.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>They lose the day in expectation of the night, and the night in fear
of the dawn.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Reasons for anxiety will never be lacking, whether born of
prosperity or of wretchedness; life pushes on in a succession of
engrossments. We shall always pray for leisure, but never enjoy it.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>knowledge of their disease has caused the death of many.</p>
