<h1>Failure to Disrupt, by Reich</h1>
<p class="date">Wednesday October 28, 2020</p>
<p>As is especially salient during a pandemic, "technology alone can't
transform education." Reich's <a href="https://failuretodisrupt.com/">book</a> nicely wraps up the most recent
edtech hype cycle, which I was more optimistic about <a href="/2011/09/10/future-of-education/">at the time</a>. Reich thinks we have to keep <a href="/2010/07/31/thoughts-on-tinkering-toward-utopia/">tinkering toward utopia</a>.</p>

</ul>
<p>I mostly agree with Reich, except that now I tend to put more weight
on knowledge à la <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._D._Hirsch">Hirsch</a>, and I still have hope for the
application of tools like <a href="/20201009-anki_is_easy/">Anki</a> in educational settings.</p>

<h3><a name="chapter1"></a>Chapter 1: Instructor-Guided Learning at Scale: Massive Open Online Courses</h3>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"To a first approximation, there are only two primary approaches to
teaching and learning. As Plutarch wrote in "On Listening" in the
first century CE, "Education is not the filling of a pail, but the
lighting of a fire."" (page 22)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reich then identifies "instructionism" and "social constructivism" as
names for these approaches, associated with Edward L. Thorndike and
John Dewey, respectively.</p>
<p>One thing I thought I noticed in edtech over the years was a trend in
which companies that focused on algorithms (like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knewton">Knewton</a>) moved
toward being more like content companies over time. In a sense they
started as pail companies, but found people wouldn't buy empty pails.
Might be related to the <a href="#chapter5">adoption problem</a>.</p>
<p>This is a fun metaphor to play with. I think it might be better as
"not the stacking of wood, but the lighting of a fire." When a fire is
burning, you want to keep getting more wood. The wood is largely the
same in both approaches; the difference is the motivation or
application around it.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"... teaching how to reason from evidence is one of the main
purposes of higher education, ..." (page 27)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"People develop self-regulated learning strategies through direct
instruction and practice, often through a long apprenticeship in
formal educational systems." (page 36)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"I have jokingly summarized the bulk of MOOC learning research as
proving Reich's Law: "People who do stuff do more stuff, and people
who do stuff do better than people who don't do stuff."" (page 39)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a slight contradiction to the above in that it says some stuff
is better than other stuff, but still a nice reference:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"It turns out that one can have terabytes of data about what people
do online and very little understanding of what changes inside their
heads." (page 39)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Since we know that most people who register for a course drop out
soon after enrollment, we start our courses with short "capsule"
units that summarize the most important ideas of the course." (page
41)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Social inequality is a tenacious feature of educational systems."
(page 42)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h3><a name="chapter2"></a>Chapter 2: Algorithm-Guided Learning at Scale: Adaptive Tutors and Computer-Assisted Instruction</h3>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"... a feature of logistic curves is that when plotted against
log-transformed <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> axes, the S-curve becomes a linear
straight line." (page 60)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This doesn't seem true. Maybe it means that with a log y axis, the
left and right sides are each approximately linear? I <a href="https://twitter.com/planarrowspace/status/1311371349957505030">tweeted</a> at
Reich about this.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Reading instructors sometimes discuss a transition, which happens
in about the third grade, from learning to read–learning how to
decode the sounds and meaning of text–to reading to learn–using
reading to advance content knowledge." (pages 63-64)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Ritter's research team looked at how much adaptive mastery learning
teachers actually allowed in their classes, and they found that some
teachers assigned work in Carnegie Learning in such a way that it
wasn't really personalized–these teachers required students to work
on problem sets related to the topics being taught at that moment to
the whole class. By contrast, other teachers allowed students to
work at their own pace, even if this meant that some students were
still doing practice problems on topics that might have been covered
in class weeks earlier. Ritter's team found that overall learning
gains were higher in the classes where students were allowed more
opportunities to move at their own pace; in other words, the
teachers who used Carnegie Learning as intended had more learning
gains in their classrooms than did the teachers who kept their
students moving in lockstep." (page 70)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Makes me think about whole-group single track, tracking, personalized
via computer, tutoring, and how these are thought about in different
ways...</p>
<hr />
<h3><a name="chapter3"></a>Chapter 3: Peer-Guided Learning at Scale: Networked Learning Communities</h3>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"The consensus about the great potential of personalized learning
depended on a stark disagreement about what the term actually
meant." (page 77)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Roughly, this is referring to personalizing <em>pace</em> (go through the
same material but at whatever speed you like) versus personalizing
<em>content</em> (choose your own area of interest, pursue it however you
want).</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"... a shift in identity where the learning activity is a part of
who they are rather than something that they do ..." (page 91)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>On page 95, a reference to
<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1207/s15326985ep4102_1">Why Minimal Guidance During Instruction Does Not Work: An Analysis of the Failure of Constructivist, Discovery, Problem-Based, Experiential, and Inquiry-Based Teaching</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The advantage of guidance begins to recede only when learners have
sufficiently high prior knowledge to provide “internal” guidance."
(from the abstract)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Put simply, people have a limited working memory, and when learners
allocate that working memory to solving a problem, they often are
not permanently encoding learning about the patterns and practices
that let them solve that type of problem." (page 95)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Reich raises the issue of people choosing to get involved in bad stuff
like hate groups. So total freedom in what to get into isn't
necessarily great.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Somehow, millions of people around the world find ways to teach and
learn with one another online without any formal training and
sometimes without any organization, and yet when designers try to
create these kinds of environments with intention, they encounter
substantial challenges with motivation and comprehension." (page
102)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is he deliberately avoiding the obvious interpretation from
selection/observation bias? In a whole world, some people have
motivation and comprehension to do great things. If you have a fixed
group of students that isn't skimming those people, many won't. It
seems highly likely that peer-guided learning at scale has the same
issue as other MOOCs, in that the people who benefit are
overwhelmingly people who are already doing really well to begin with.</p>
<hr />
<p>Thinking about the various ways to do whole class together vs. totally
personalized/independent learning... When I was teaching,
"differentiation" was the popular term for customizing class
activities for students who were struggling or way ahead...</p>
<p>I think really, there's some stuff that we want all students to learn,
and there are learning experiences that make sense to do with a whole
class: stuff about working in groups, communication, etc. It would be
neat to have more explicit separation between a small whole-group set
of content, and scaffolding for students to study more things on their
own.</p>
<hr />
<h3><a name="chapter4"></a>Chapter 4: Testing the Genres of Learning at Scale: Learning Games</h3>
<hr />
<p>The difficulty of <em>transfer</em> (mentioned page 109) makes me wonder to
what extent transfer is related to general intelligence - or whether
they might even be largely the same thing.</p>
<p>The referenced <em>Critical Thinking: Why Is It So Hard to Teach?</em>
(<a href="https://www.readingrockets.org/article/critical-thinking-why-it-so-hard-teach">web</a>, <a href="https://www.aft.org/sites/default/files/periodicals/Crit_Thinking.pdf">more complete PDF</a>) is quite good.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"A more pessimistic view built upon the research on transfer is that
people who spend a lot of time playing <em>Minecraft</em> will primarily
learn about playing <em>Minecraft</em>." (page 119)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But: some reasonable notes on, for example, the general strategy of
knowing to look things up online.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Domain-independent skills are slightly useful in lots of different
domains but not deeply useful in any particular domain." (page 120)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"an <em>edtech Matthew effect</em> is quite common: that new technologies
disproportionately benefit learners with the financial, social, and
technical capital to take advantage of new innovations." (page 125)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Prw3xbk1Wo&amp;ab_channel=HippoCrit">Zoombinis</a> game seems kind of neat? Maybe mathier puzzles than
other puzzle games? Or not? Shrug?</p>
<hr />
<h3><a name="chapter5"></a>Chapter 5: The Curse of the Familiar</h3>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"The dilemma that Resnick and colleagues face as Scratch is widely
adopted in schools is that a variety of typical school structures
are inimical to the pedagogical philosophy behind Scratch." (page
134)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think Reich is neglecting something that Scratch has in common with
most edtech, and which he comments on for other types: Learning with
Scratch depends hugely on the student being prepared for and/or having
characteristics that align with learning with Scratch.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Another approach from the Scratch team has been to develop decks of
physical coding cards ..." (page 138)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://nostarch.com/scratchcards3">Published</a> by No Starch.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"... Getting Unstuck, a twenty-one-day email-based course during
which participants received daily creative challenges, ..." (page
140)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://gettingunstuck.gse.harvard.edu/about">From</a> Harvard. Aha! They have <a href="https://gettingunstuck.gse.harvard.edu/strategies">strategies for getting unstuck</a>!</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Education technology is a good field for those who see themselves
as patient optimists." (page 147)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h3><a name="chapter6"></a>Chapter 6: The Edtech Matthew Effect</h3>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Sociologist Tressie McMillan Cottom argues that technologists often
imagine their students as "roaming autodidacts," which she describes
as "a self-motivated, able learner that is simultaneously embedded
in technocratic futures <em>and</em> disembedded from place, culture,
history, and markets."" (page 159)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h3><a name="chapter7"></a>Chapter 7: The Trap of Routine Assessment</h3>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Autograders excel at assessing routine tasks. These are exactly the
kinds of tasks that we no longer need humans to do." (page 171)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is incomplete. There are lots of basic things that humans need to
be able to do that can be assessed automatically. But I agree that
higher-level skills are difficult to assess automatically.</p>
<hr />
<p>Reich makes an example of a plumber who installs a water heater with
an LED panel and then says on page 175: "What would it be like to
explain to the young men in that apprenticeship program that fifty
years later, plumbers would be computer programmers?" This isn't the
case. The plumber who in fact installed his water heater didn't do any
programming. This was a bad example for the point I think Reich hoped
to make.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"... the "reification fallacy," when we uncritically believe that
something's name accurately represents what that thing actually is."
(page 176)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Somewhat unusual way of explaining <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reification_(fallacy)">this</a>. Interesting.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Computers can mostly assess what computers are good at doing, and
these are things we do not need humans to do in the labor market."
(page 197)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I already commented on this, but I'll comment again: I think he's
ignoring the many things that humans should be able to do that
computers can also do. I'm thinking mostly of simple recall, where
knowing something by heart (immediately) is way better than being able
to look it up (if you even know that it exists, to look up).</p>
<hr />
<h3><a name="chapter8"></a>Chapter 8: The Toxic Power of Data and Experiments</h3>
<hr />
<p>Mostly, I think Reich is pulling punches in this chapter. He doesn't
go where I thought he was going to: He doesn't really address possible
abuses of student data or the negative effects that can arise
(intentionally or accidentally) from data and experiment.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"If online learning leads to better outcomes from students, it will
be through the amalgamation of a thousand or ten thousand studies
like this one that incrementally accrete a knowledge base about
effective online learning." (page 223)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think Reich takes his "tinkering" a little too far sometimes. If
what's really needed is a bigger leap, ten thousand incremental
experiments won't necessarily get there.</p>
<hr />
<h3><a name="conclusion"></a>Conclusion: Preparing for the Next Learning-at-Scale Hype Cycle</h3>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"In 1913, Thomas Edision declared that the age of books was about to
give way to the age of motion pictures. He told an interviewer,
"Books will soon be obsolete in the public schools. Scholars will be
instructed through the eye. It is possible to teach every branch of
human knowledge with the motion picture. Our school system will be
completely changed inside of ten years." When Edison's ten-year
prediction failed to come to pass, he simple gave himself more time.
In 1923, speaking before the Federal Trade Commission, Edison
explained, "I made an experiment with a lot of [motion] pictures to
teach children chemistry. I got twelve children and asked them to
write down what they had learned, from the [motion] pictures. I was
amazed that such a complicated subject as chemistry was readily
grasped by them to a large extent through [motion] pictures. The
parts of the [motion] pictures they did not understand I did over
and over again until they finally understood the entire [motion]
picture. I think motion pictures have just started and it is my
opinion that in 20 years children will be taught through [motion]
pictures and not through textbooks."" (pages 229-230)</p>

<p>It was worth reading the book just for these quotes, for this
video-hater.</p>
