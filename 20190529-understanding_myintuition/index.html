<h1>Understanding MyinTuition</h1>
<p class="date">Wednesday May 29, 2019</p>
<p><a href="https://myintuition.org/">MyinTuition</a> is a simple online college
cost estimator for about 50 schools. I was curious about how it
worked, so I figured it out. I suspect they don't want me to say, and
I like them, so I won't. But here are some of my opinions and
experiences.</p>
<p>The rhetoric around MyinTuition is all about transparency, as in the
creator's 2014 paper about it, <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/12_transparency_in_college_costs_levine.pdf)">Transparency in College Costs</a>.
They want to be transparent about this message:
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/06/05/opinion/columnists/what-college-really-costs.html">Top Colleges Are Cheaper Than You Think (Unless Youâ€™re Rich)</a>.</p>
<p>College affordability is important. An expanded idea of transparency
might further include how the MyinTuition calculations are done, and
how the different schools vary. That's what I was curious about.</p>
<p>I originally thought I'd try to use machine learning to understand how
MyinTuition works, which would mean first collecting training data.
I'm not sure this was ever a good idea. For one thing, it doesn't seem
practical if data collection is severely rate-limited.</p>
<p>I explored on and off for a couple months. It was fun! It wouldn't be
as much fun to do now, what with the <a href="https://www.google.com/recaptcha/">CAPTCHA</a>s they've put
in. And unfortunately it may no longer be possible to access
MyinTuition at all using the IP addresses I was on at the time.</p>
<p>Figuring out the MyinTuition calculations and parameters for different
schools was interesting. I'll just recommend that you try a bunch of
schools and see what you get. You can find the calculators for all
participating schools <a href="https://myintuition.org/quick-college-cost-estimator/">on their site</a>.</p>
<p>Never stop learning, kids!</p>
