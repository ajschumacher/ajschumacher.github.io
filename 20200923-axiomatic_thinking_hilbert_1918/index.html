<h1>Axiomatic Thinking (Hilbert, 1918)</h1>
<p class="date">Wednesday September 23, 2020</p>
<p>I had difficulty finding this online, so I'm posting it here for
reference.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="#1" name="1">¬∂</a> Just as in the life of nations the
individual nation can only thrive when all neighbouring nations are in
good health; and just as the interest of states demands, not only that
order prevail within every individual state, but also that the
relationships of the states among themselves be in good order; so it
is in the life of the sciences. In due recognition of this fact the
most important bearers of mathematical thought have always evinced
great interest in the laws and the structure of the neighbouring
sciences; above all for the benefit of mathematics itself they have
always cultivated the relations to the neighbouring sciences,
especially to the great empires of physics and epistemology. I believe
that the essence of these relations, and the reason for their
fruitfulness, will appear most clearly if I describe for you the
general method of research which seems to be coming more and more into
its own in modern mathematics: I mean the <em>axiomatic method</em>.</p>
<p><a href="#2" name="2">¬∂</a> When we assemble the facts of a definite,
more-or-less comprehensive field of knowledge, we soon notice that
these facts are capable of being ordered. This ordering always comes
about with the help of a certain <em>framework of concepts</em>
[<em>Fachwerk von Begriffen</em>] in the following way: a concept of this
framework corresponds to each individual object of the field of
knowledge, and a logical relation between concepts corresponds to
every fact within the field of knowledge. The framework of concepts is
nothing other than the <em>theory</em> of the field of knowledge.</p>
<p><a href="#3" name="3">¬∂</a> Thus the facts of geometry order
themselves into a geometry, the facts of arithmetic into a theory of
numbers, the facts of statics, mechanics, electrodynamics into a
theory of statics, mechanics, electrodynamics, or the facts from the
physics of gases into a theory of gases. It is precisely the same with
the fields of knowledge of thermodynamics, geometrical optics,
elementary radiation-theory, the conduction of heat, or also with the
calculus of probabilities or the theory of sets. It even holds of
special fields of knowledge in pure mathematics, such as the theory of
surfaces, the theory of Galois equations, and the theory of prime
numbers, no less than for several fields of knowledge that lie far
from mathematics, such as certain parts of psychophysics or the theory
of money.</p>
<p><a href="#4" name="4">¬∂</a> If we consider a particular theory more
closely, we always see that a few distinguished propositions of the
field of knowledge underlie the construction of the framework of
concepts, and these propositions then suffice by themselves for the
construction, in accordance with logical principles, of the entire
framework.</p>
<p><a href="#5" name="5">¬∂</a> Thus in geometry the proposition of the
linearity of the equation of the plane and of the orthogonal
transformation of point-coordinates is completely adequate to produce
the whole broad science of spatial Euclidean geometry purely by means
of analysis. Moreover, the laws of calculation and the rules for
integers suffice for the construction of number theory. In statics the
same role is played by the proposition of the parallelogram of forces;
in mechanics, say, by the Lagrangian differential equations of motion;
and in electrodynamics by the Maxwell equations together with the
requirement of the rigidity and charge of the electron. Thermodynamics
can be completely built up from the concept of energy function and the
definition of temperature and pressure as derivatives of its
variables, entropy and volume. At the heart of the elementary theory
of radiation is Kirchhoff's theorem on the relationships between
emission and absorption; in the calculus of probabilities the Gaussian
law of errors is the fundamental proposition; in the theory of gases,
the proposition that entropy is the negative logarithm of the
probability of the state; in the theory of surfaces, the
representation of the element of arc by the quadratic differential
form; in the theory of equations, the proposition concerning the
existence of roots; in the theory of prime numbers, the proposition
concerning the reality and frequency of Rieman's function ùúÅ(s).</p>
<p><a href="#6" name="6">¬∂</a> These fundamental propositions can be
regarded from an initial standpoint as the <em>axioms of the individual
fields of knowledge</em>: the progressive development of the individual
field of knowledge then lies solely in the further logical
construction of the already mentioned framework of concepts. This
standpoint is especially predominant in pure mathematics, and to the
corresponding manner of working we owe the mighty development of
geometry, of arithmetic, of the theory of functions, and of the whole
of analysis.</p>
<p><a href="#7" name="7">¬∂</a> Thus in the cases mentioned above the
problem of grounding the individual field of knowledge had found a
solution; but this solution was only temporary. In fact, in the
individual fields of knowledge the need arose to ground the
fundamental axiomatic propositions themselves. So one acquired
'proofs' of the linearity of the equation of the plane and the
orthogonality of the transformation expressing a movement, of the laws
of arithmetical calculation, of the parallelogram of forces, of the
Lagrangian equations of motion, of Kirchhoff's law regarding emission
and absorption, of the law of entropy, and of the proposition
concerning the existence of roots of an equation.</p>
<p><a href="#8" name="8">¬∂</a> But critical examination of these 'proofs'
shows that they are not in themselves proofs, but basically only make
it possible to trace things back to certain deeper propositions, which
in turn are now to be regarded as new axioms instead of the
propositions to be proved. The actual so-called <em>axioms</em> of geometry,
arithmetic, statics, mechanics, radiation theory, or thermodynamics
arose in this way. These axioms form a layer of axioms which lies
deeper than the axiom-layer given by the recently-mentioned
fundamental theorems of the individual field of knowledge. The
procedure of the axiomatic method, as it is expressed here, amounts to
a <em>deepening of the foundations</em> of the individual domains of
knowledge‚Äîa deepening that is necessary for every edifice that one
wishes to expand and to build higher while preserving its stability.</p>
<p><a href="#9" name="9">¬∂</a> If the theory of a field of knowledge‚Äîthat
is, the framework of concepts that represents it‚Äîis to serve its
purpose of orienting and ordering, then it must satisfy two
requirements above all: <em>first</em> it should give us an overview of the
<em>independence</em> and <em>dependence</em> of the propositions of the theory;
<em>second</em>, it should give us a guarantee of the <em>consistency</em> of all
the propositions of the theory. In particular, the axioms of each
theory are to be examined from these two points of view.</p>
<p><a href="#10" name="10">¬∂</a> Let us first consider the independence
or dependence of the axioms.</p>
<p><a href="#11" name="11">¬∂</a> The <em>axiom of parallels</em> in geometry is
the classical example of the independence of an axiom. When he placed
the parallel postulate among the axioms, Euclid thereby denied that
the proposition of parallels is implied by the other axioms. Euclid's
method of investigation became the paradigm for axiomatic research,
and since Euclid geometry has been the prime example of an axiomatic
science.</p>
<p><a href="#12" name="12">¬∂</a> Classical mechanics furnishes another
example of an investigation of the independence of axioms. The
Lagrangian equations of motion were temporarily able to count as
axioms of mechanics‚Äîfor mechanics can of course be entirely based on
these equations when they are generally formulated for arbitrary
forces and arbitrary side-constraints. But further investigation shows
that it is not necessary in the construction of mechanics to
presuppose arbitrary forces or arbitrary side-constraints; thus the
system of presuppositions can be reduced. This piece of knowledge
leads, on the one hand, to the axiom system of Boltzmann, who assumes
only forces (and indeed special central forces) but no
side-constraints, and the axiom system of Hertz, who discards forces
and makes do with side-constraints (and indeed special
side-constraints with rigid connections). These two axiom systems form
a deeper layer in the progressive axiomatization of mechanics.</p>
<p><a href="#13" name="13">¬∂</a> If in establishing the theory of Galois
equations we assume as an axiom the existence of roots of an equation,
then this is certainly a dependent axiom; for, as Gauss was the first
to show, that existence theorem can be proved from the axioms of
arithmetic.</p>
<p><a href="#14" name="14">¬∂</a> Something similar would happen if we
were to assume as an axiom in the theory of prime numbers the
proposition about the reality of the zeroes of the Riemann
ùúÅ(s)-function: as we progress to a deeper layer of purely arithmetical
axioms the proof of this reality-proposition would become necessary,
and only this proof would guarantee the reliability of the important
conclusions which we have already achieved for the theory of prime
numbers by taking it as a postulate.</p>
<p><a href="#15" name="15">¬∂</a> A particularly interesting question for
axiomatics concerns the independence of the propositions of a field of
knowledge from the axiom of <em>continuity</em>.</p>
<p><a href="#16" name="16">¬∂</a> In the theory of real numbers it is
shown that the axiom of measurement‚Äîthe so-called Archimedean axiom‚Äîis
independent of all the other arithmetical axioms. As everybody knows,
this information is of great significance for geometry; but it seems
to me to be of capital interest for physics as well, for it leads to
the following result: the fact that by adjoining terrestrial distances
to one another we can achieve the dimensions and distances of bodies
in outer space (that is, that we can measure heavenly distances with
an earthly yardstick) and the fact that the distances within an atom
can all be expressed in terms of metres‚Äîthese facts are not at all a
mere logical consequence of propositions about the congruence of
triangles or about geometric configurations, but are a result of
empirical research. The validity of the Archimedean axiom in nature
stands in just as much need of confirmation by experiment as does the
familiar proposition about the sum of the angles of a triangle.</p>
<p><a href="#17" name="17">¬∂</a> In general, I should like to formulate
the axiom of continuity in physics as follows: 'If for the validity of
a proposition of physics we prescribe any degree of accuracy
whatsoever, then it is possible to indicate small regions within which
the presuppositions that have been made for the proposition may vary
freely, without the deviation of the proposition exceeding the
prescribed degree of accuracy.' This axiom basically does nothing more
than express something that already lies in the essence of experiment;
it is constantly presupposed by the physicists, although it has not
previously been formulated.</p>
<p><a href="#18" name="18">¬∂</a> For example, if one follows Planck and
derives the second law of thermodynamics from the axiom of the
impossibility of a <em>perpetuum mobile of the second sort</em>, then this
axiom of continuity must be used in the derivation.</p>
<p><a href="#19" name="19">¬∂</a> By invoking the theorem that the
continuum can be well-ordered, Hamel has shown in a most interesting
manner that, in the foundations of statics, the axiom of continuity is
necessary for the proof of the theorem concerning the <em>parallelogram
of forces</em>‚Äîat any rate, given the most obvious choice of other axioms.</p>
<p><a href="#20" name="20">¬∂</a> The axioms of classical mechanics can be
deepened if, using the axiom of continuity, one imagines continuous
motion to be decomposed into small straight-line movements caused by
discrete impulses and following one another in rapid succession. One
then applies Bertrand's maximum principle as the essential axiom of
mechanics, according to which the motion that actually occurs after
each impulse is that which maximizes the kinetic energy of the system
with respect to all motions that are compatible with the law of the
conservation of energy.</p>
<p><a href="#21" name="21">¬∂</a> The most recent ways of laying the
foundations of physics‚Äîof electrodynamics in particular‚Äîare all
theories of the continuum, and therefore raise the demand for
continuity in the most extreme fashion. But I should prefer not to
discuss them because the investigations are not yet completed.</p>
<p><a href="#22" name="22">¬∂</a> We shall now examine the second of the
two points of view mentioned above, namely, the question concerning
the <em>consistency</em> of the axioms. This question is obviously of the
greatest importance, for the presence of a contradiction in a theory
manifestly threatens the contents of the entire theory.</p>
<p><a href="#23" name="23">¬∂</a> Even for successful theories that have
long been accepted, it is difficult to know that they are internally
consistent: I remind you of the reversibility and recurrence paradox
in the kinetic theory of gases.</p>
<p><a href="#24" name="24">¬∂</a> It often happens that the internal
consistency of a theory is regarded as obvious, while in reality the
proof requires deep mathematical developments. For example, consider a
problem from the elementary theory of the <em>conduction of heat</em>‚Äînamely,
the distribution of temperatures within a homogeneous body whose
surfaces are maintained at a definite temperature that varies from
place to place: then in fact the requirement that there be an
equilibrium of temperatures involves no internal theoretical
contradiction. But to know this it is necessary to prove that the
familiar boundary-value problem of potential theory is always
solvable; for only this proof shows that a temperature distribution
satisfying the equations of the conduction of heat is at all possible.</p>
<p><a href="#25" name="25">¬∂</a> But particularly in physics it is not
sufficient that the propositions of a theory be in harmony with each
other; there remains the requirement that they not contradict the
propositions of a neighbouring field of knowledge.</p>
<p><a href="#26" name="26">¬∂</a> Thus, as I showed earlier, the axioms of
the elementary theory of radiation can be used to prove not only
<em>Kirchhoff's law</em> of emission and absorption, but also a special law
about the reflection and refraction of individual beams of light,
namely, the law: If two beams of natural light and of the same energy
each fall on the surface separating two media from different sides in
such a way that one beam after its reflection, and the other after its
passage, each have the same direction, then the beam that arises from
uniting the two is also of natural light and of the same energy. This
theorem is, as the facts show, not at all in contradiction with
optics, but can be derived as a conclusion from the electromagnetic
theory of light.</p>
<p><a href="#27" name="27">¬∂</a> As is well known, the results of the
<em>kinetic theory of gases</em> are in full harmony with thermodynamics.</p>
<p><a href="#28" name="28">¬∂</a> Similarly, <em>electrodynamic inertia</em> and
<em>Einsteinian gravitation</em> are compatible with the corresponding
concepts of the classical theories, since the classical concepts can
be conceived as limiting cases of the more general concepts in the new
theories.</p>
<p><a href="#29" name="29">¬∂</a> In contrast, <em>modern quantum theory</em> and
our developing knowledge of the internal structure of the atom have
led to laws which virtually contradict the earlier electrodynamics,
which was essentially built on the Maxwell equations; modern
electrodynamics therefore needs‚Äîas everybody acknowledges‚Äîa new
foundation and essential reformulation.</p>
<p><a href="#30" name="30">¬∂</a> As one can see from what has already
been said, the contradictions that arise in physical theories are
always eliminated by changing the selection of the axioms; the
difficulty is to make the selection so that all the observed physical
laws are logical consequences of the chosen axioms.</p>
<p><a href="#31" name="31">¬∂</a> But matters are different when
contradictions appear in purely theoretical fields of knowledge. Set
theory contains the classic example of such an occurrence, namely, in
the <em>paradox of the set of all sets</em>, which goes back to Cantor. This
paradox is so serious that distinguished mathematicians, for example,
Kronecker and Poincar√©, felt compelled by it to deny that set
theory‚Äîone of the most fruitful and powerful branches of knowledge
anywhere in mathematics‚Äîhas any justification for existing.</p>
<p><a href="#32" name="32">¬∂</a> But in this precarious state of affairs
as well, the axiomatic method came to the rescue. By setting up
appropriate axioms which in a precise way restricted both the
arbitrariness of the definitions of sets and the admissibility of
statements about their elements, Zermelo succeeded in developing set
theory in such a way that the contradictions disappear, but the scope
and applicability of set theory remain the same.</p>
<p><a href="#33" name="33">¬∂</a> In all previous cases it was a matter of
contradictions that had emerged in the course of the development of a
theory and that needed to be eliminated by a reformulation of the
axiom system. But if we wish to restore the reputation of mathematics
as the exemplar of the most rigorous science it is not enough merely
to avoid the existing contradictions. The chief requirement of the
theory of axioms must go farther, namely, to show that within every
field of knowledge contradictions based on the underlying axiom-system
are <em>absolutely impossible</em>.</p>
<p><a href="#34" name="34">¬∂</a> In accordance with this requirement I
have proved the consistency of the axioms laid down in the <em>Grundlagen
der Geometrie</em> by showing that any contradiction in the consequences
of the geometrical axioms must necessarily apppear in the arithmetic
of the system of real numbers as well.</p>
<p><a href="#35" name="35">¬∂</a> For the fields of physical knowledge
too, it is clearly sufficient to reduce the problem of <em>internal
consistency</em> to the consistency of the arithmetical axioms. Thus I
showed the consistency of the axioms of the <em>elementary theory of
radiation</em> by constructing its axiom system out of analytically
independent pieces‚Äîpresupposing in the process the consistency of
analysis.</p>
<p><a href="#36" name="36">¬∂</a> One may and should in some circumstances
proceed similarly in the construction of a mathematical theory. For
example, if in the development of the theory of Galois groups we have
taken the proposition of the <em>existence of roots</em> as an axiom, or if
in the theory of prime numbers we have taken the hypothesis concerning
the <em>reality of the zeros</em> of the Riemann ùúÅ(s)-function as an axiom,
then in each case the proof of the consistency of the axiom system
comes down to a proof, using the means of analysis, of the proposition
of the existence of roots or of the Riemann hypothesis concerning
ùúÅ(s)‚Äîand only then has the theory been securely completed.</p>
<p><a href="#37" name="37">¬∂</a> The problem of the consistency of the
axiom system for the <em>real numbers</em> can likewise be reduced by the use
of set-theoretic concepts to the same problem for the integers: this
is the merit of the theories of the irrational numbers developed by
Weierstrass and Dedekind.</p>
<p><a href="#38" name="38">¬∂</a> In only two cases is this method of
reduction to another special domain of knowledge clearly not
available, namely, when it is a matter of the axioms for the
<em>integers</em> themselves, and when it is a matter of the foundation of
<em>set theory</em>; for here there is no other discipline besides logic
which it would be possi-ble to invoke.</p>
<p><a href="#39" name="39">¬∂</a> But since the examination of consistency
is a task that cannot be avoided, it appears necessary to axiomatize
logic itself and to prove that number theory and set theory are only
parts of logic.</p>
<p><a href="#40" name="40">¬∂</a> This method was prepared long ago (not
least by Frege's profound investigations); it has been most
successfully explained by the acute mathematician and logician
Russell. One could regard the completion of this magnificent
Russellian enterprise of the <em>axiomatization of logic</em> as the crowning
achievement of the work of axiomatization as a whole.</p>
<p><a href="#41" name="41">¬∂</a> But this completion will require further
work. When we consider the matter more closely we soon recognize that
the question of the consistency of the integers and of sets is not one
that stands alone, but that it belongs to a vast domain of difficult
epistemological questions which have a specifically mathematical tint:
for example (to characterize this domain of questions briefly) the
problem of the <em>solvability in principle of every mathematical
question</em>, the problem of the subsequent <em>checkability</em> of the results
of a mathematical investigation, the question of a <em>criterion of
simplicity</em> for mathematical proofs, the question of the relationship
between <em>content and formalism</em> in mathematics and logic, and finally
the problem of the <em>decidability</em> of a mathematical question in a
finite number of operations.</p>
<p><a href="#42" name="42">¬∂</a> We cannot rest content with the
axiomatization of logic until all questions of this sort and their
interconnections have been understood and cleared up.</p>
<p><a href="#43" name="43">¬∂</a> Among the mentioned questions, the
last‚Äînamely, the one concerning decidability in a finite number of
operations‚Äîis the best-known and the most discussed; for it goes to
the essence of mathematical thought.</p>
<p><a href="#44" name="44">¬∂</a> I should like to increase the interest
in this question by indicating several particular mathematical
problems in which it plays a role.</p>
<p><a href="#45" name="45">¬∂</a> In the theory of <em>algebraic invariants</em>
we have the fundamental theorem that there is always a finite number
of whole rational invariants by means of which all other such
invariants can be represented. In my opinion, my first general proof
of this theorem completely satisfied our requirements of simplicity
and perspicuity; but it is impossible to reformulate this proof so
that we can obtain from it a statable bound for the number of the
finitely many invariants of the full system, let alone obtain an
actual listing of them. Instead, new principles and considerations of
a completely different sort were necessary in order to show that the
construction of the full system of invariants requires only a finite
number of operations, and that this number is less than a bound that
can be stated before the calculation.</p>
<p><a href="#46" name="46">¬∂</a> We see the same thing happening in an
example from the <em>theory of surfaces</em>. It is a fundamental question in
the geometry of surfaces of the fourth order to determine the maximum
number of separate sheets it takes to make up such a surface.</p>
<p><a href="#47" name="47">¬∂</a> The first step towards an answer to this
question is the proof that the number of sheets of a curved surface
must be finite. This can easily be shown function-theoretically as
follows. One assumes the existence of infinitely many sheets, and
selects a point inside each spatial region bounded by a sheet. A point
of accumulation for these infinitely many chosen points would then be
a point of a singularity that is excluded for an algebraic surface.</p>
<p><a href="#48" name="48">¬∂</a> This function-theoretic path does not at
all lead to an upper bound for the number of surface-sheets. For that,
we need instead certain observations on the number of cut-points,
which then show that the number of sheets certainly cannot be greater
than 12.</p>
<p><a href="#49" name="49">¬∂</a> The second method, entirely different
from the first, in turn cannot be applied or transformed to decide
whether a surface of the fourth order with twelve sheets actually
exists.</p>
<p><a href="#50" name="50">¬∂</a> Since a quaternary form of the fourth
order possesses 35 homogeneous coefficients, we can conceive of a
given surface of the fourth order as a point in 34-dimensional space.
The discriminant of the quaternary form of fourth order is of degree
108 in its coefficients; if it is set equal to zero, it accordingly
represents in 34-dimensional space a surface of order 108. Since the
coefficients of the discriminant are themselves determinate integers,
the topological character of the discriminant surface can be precisely
determined by the rules that are familiar to us from 2- and
3-dimensional space; so we can obtain precise information about the
nature and significance of the individual subdomains into which the
discriminant surface partitions the 34-dimensional space. Now, the
surfaces of fourth order represented by points of these subdomains all
certainly possess the same sheet-number; and it is accordingly
possible to establish, by a long and wearying but finite calculation,
whether we have a surface of fourth order with n ‚â§ 12 sheets or not.</p>
<p><a href="#51" name="51">¬∂</a> The geometric method just described is
thus a third way of treating our question about the maximum number of
sheets of a surface of the fourth order. It proves the decidability of
this question in a finite number of opera-tions. So in principle an
important demand of our problem has been satisfied: it has been
reduced to a problem of the level of difficulty of determining the \(
10^{(10^{10})} \)th numeral in the decimal expansion for ùúã‚Äîa task
which is clearly solvable, but which remains unsolved.</p>
<p><a href="#52" name="52">¬∂</a> Rather, it took a profound and difficult
algebraic-geometric investigation by Rohn to show that 11 sheets are
not possible in a surface of the fourth order, while 10 sheets
actually occur. Only this fourth method delivered the full solution of
the problem.</p>
<p><a href="#53" name="53">¬∂</a> These particular discussions show how a
variety of methods of proof can be applied to the same problem, and
they ought to suggest how necessary it is to study the essence of
mathematical proof itself if one wishes to answer such questions as
the one about decidability in a finite number of operations.</p>
<p><a href="#54" name="54">¬∂</a> All such questions of principle, which I
characterized above and of which the question just discussed‚Äîthat is,
the question about decidability in a finite number of operations‚Äîwas
only the last, seem to me to form an important new field of research
which remains to be developed. To conquer this field we must, I am
persuaded, make the concept of specifically mathematical proof itself
into an object of investigation, just as the astronomer considers the
movement of his position, the physicist studies the theory of his
apparatus, and the philosopher criticizes reason itself.</p>
<p><a href="#55" name="55">¬∂</a> To be sure, the execution of this
programme is at present still an unsolved task.</p>
<p><a href="#56" name="56">¬∂</a> In conclusion, I should like to sum up
in a few sentences my general conception of the essence of the
axiomatic method. I believe: anything at all that can be the object of
scientific thought becomes dependent on the axiomatic method, and
thereby indirectly on mathematics, as soon as it is ripe for the
for-mation of a theory. By pushing ahead to ever deeper layers of
axioms in the sense explained above we also win ever-deeper insights
into the essence of scien-tific thought itself, and we become ever
more conscious of the unity of our knowledge. In the sign of the
axiomatic method, mathematics is summoned to a leading role in
science.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="#from" name="from">From</a> Ewald's introduction to the
above, in <em>From Kant to Hilbert</em>, volume 2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Hilbert is persistently misconstrued as a 'formalist', i.e. as
somebody who was so shaken by the paradoxes that he took up the
theory that mathematics is merely a game played with meaningless
symbols. But the intellectual background to Hilbert's proof theory
was richer than this. To be sure, the paradoxes were an important
goad; but he had more positive ambitions than the mere avoidance of
paradox. (Hilbert, in fact, in his unpublished G√∂ttingen lectures,
repeatedly indicated that in his opinion Zermelo's work had
successfully resolved the known paradoxes.) His study of the
axiomatic foundations of geometry had yielded a rich harvest of
mathematical results‚Äînon-Archimedean geometries, a new topological
characterization of the plane, new theorems on the nature of
continuity‚Äîand there was every reason to hope that the same powerful
tool would prove equally useful in the other branches of mathematics
and physics mentioned in this article.</p>
<p>"As for the term 'formalist', it is so misleading that it should be
abandoned altogether as a label for Hilbert's philosophy of
mathematics. On the face of it, 'formalism' is not a felicitous
description for the style of reasoning one finds in <em>Anschauliche
Geometrie‚Äì'Intuitive geometry' (Hilbert and Cohn-Vossen 1932)</em>, a
work which was written at the high-point of Hilbert's work in proof
theory; nor does it accurately convey the convictions of the man
who, in his G√∂ttingen lectures, derided those who saw mathematics as
a mere heaping-up of consequences mechanically derived from a given
stock of axioms; nor the man who ended his essay, 'On the infinite',
by saying, 'We gain a conviction that runs counter to the earlier
endeavours of Frege and Dedekind, the conviction that, if scientific
knowledge is to be possible, certain intuitive conceptions
[Vorstellungen] and insights are indispensable; logic alone does not
suffice' (<em>Hilbert 1926</em>). As the present selection makes clear,
Hilbert viewed formal axiom systems instrumentally, as a powerful
tool for mathematical research, a tool to be employed when a field
had reached a point of sufficient ripeness. But he nowhere suggests
that the whole of mathematics can simply be <em>identified</em> with the
study of formal systems; and indeed in his proof-theoretical
writings he took considerable pains to point out that the genuine
mathematics‚Äì<em>inhaltliche Mathematik</em>‚Äìtakes place, not in the
formalism, but in the meta-language. For all these reasons, Hilbert
himself rejected the label 'formalist' (see, for example, <em>Hilbert
1931a</em>, ¬ß35), and students of his thought would do well to follow
his example."</p>
