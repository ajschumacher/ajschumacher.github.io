<h1>The Enchiridion in 52 sentences</h1>
<p class="date">Thursday January  7, 2021</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enchiridion_of_Epictetus">Enchiridion</a> isn't long, but it also doesn't have chapter
names, so I thought I'd write <a href="/20200715-communicate_immediately/#line">one-line summaries</a>. I referred to
the <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Enchiridion-Epictetus/dp/B08BG7536P/">Long</a>, <a href="http://classics.mit.edu/Epictetus/epicench.html">Carter</a>, and (most preferred) <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cDbKtlPBxvWJdkDMXWkSAbOeYCHHg8Fj/view">Eliot</a> translations.</p>

    ignore it.</li>

    world.</li>
<li>Do not rush into hedonism, but consider also the satisfaction of
    self control.</li>
<li>Don't be afraid to be seen doing what you think is good to do.</li>
<li>Moderate your desires and share with others.</li>
<li>You can't be something else by pretending, and in pretending you
    also fail to be you.</li>
<li>As you protect your hand from being burned, take care to protect
    your state of mind.</li>
