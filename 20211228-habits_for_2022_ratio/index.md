# Habits for 2022: “ratio”

In 2021, I worked on improving my [daily routine][]. I need to keep
working on it, but as 2022 approaches, I was thinking about other
changes to make. In the CGP Grey “[theme][]” style, I might say
“ratio” as in “ratio of quality to junk.” Here are some practices I
think can support this:

 * **Only check the news on Sundays.** I check the news (and my phone
   generally) too much, and it doesn't really make my life better to
   check the news several times a day. Sunday is the day for news.
 * **Keep a book ready in Kindle app.** When I _do_ pick up my phone,
   there should be something worthwhile there. Read a book, or put the
   phone down.
 * **Skim more.** I overcommit to reading things the slow way, which
   takes a lot of time and prevents me from opening books I don't want
   to commit to. I hate the phrase “speed reading” because I don't
   think it's real reading, but skimming in the sense of “survey” in
   [SQ3R][] is a distinct thing that's worthwhile. I recently did a
   quick [book review][] based on skimming and I thought it was fair
   and I learned a few things too. Skimming could get me connected
   with my backlog of nonfiction.
