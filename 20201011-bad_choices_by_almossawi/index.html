<h1>Bad Choices, by Almossawi</h1>
<p class="date">Sunday October 11, 2020</p>
<p>I enjoyed Almossawi's illustrated introduction to computational
thinking, which is <a href="https://bookofbadchoices.com/">freely available</a> online. I've been <a href="https://github.com/ajschumacher/ajschumacher.github.io/issues/198">thinking</a>
about non-fiction(ish) books for kids, and this one could be read by
middle-schoolers, I think, and possibly spark interest in learning
more. It illustrates the challenges and rewards of telling stories
about computer science topics.</p>
<hr />
<p>Almossawi has one of his distinctive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map">mind map</a>s toward the end of
the book. Linearized, the topics in the book look something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fundamentals<ul>
<li>Stacks</li>
<li>Arrays</li>
<li>Linked lists</li>
<li>Asymptotic notation</li>
<li>Worst, average cases</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Searching<ul>
<li>Binary search</li>
<li>Linear search</li>
<li>Hash tables</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sorting<ul>
<li>Library sort</li>
<li>Priority queues</li>
<li>Mergesort</li>
<li>Quicksort</li>
<li>Insertion sort</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Graphs<ul>
<li>Maze-solving</li>
<li>Link analysis</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Strings<ul>
<li>Huffman coding</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>"Note that all the lines in this book are plotted on a log-log
scale, which is why the shapes of the lines are the way they are."
(page xi)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would have liked to see this better explained. The lines are never
labeled, and I'm not sure why this was intentional.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The lines in those graphs were intentionally unlabeled." (page 137)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unless it was for this reason:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In my experience, any learning environment that encourages students
to be fast learners is setting its students up for failure." (page
xi)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's interesting, but I'm not sure it's a good justification. At
least, I think it would be good to be explicit, like: "Add your own
labels to these," if that's what the reader is supposed to do.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"If you look at human history, you're likely to find that many of
the names you recognize belong to people who were educated as
apprentices rather than as note takers." (page 3)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The "to learn more" section says this is from "Most Likely to Succeed:
Preparing Our Kids for the Innovation Era."</p>
<hr />
<p>A glitch in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding">Huffman coding</a> example (starting page 69) is
corrected in the <a href="https://github.com/almossawi/badchoices/wiki/Errata">errata</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Interestingly, though, Morse determined the frequency of various
letters not by talking to experts or conducting a study or analyzing
data, but by counting the number of types in a printer's type box.
So the next time a pedant questions your research methods, take
heart." (page 72)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> published an article recently about the
rise of scrabble champions in Nigeria, and how their winning edge
isn't necessarily due to a better vocabulary but rather to the
counterintuitive tactic of opting for shorter words." (page 80)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The "to learn more" section references <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/for-nigerian-scrabble-stars-short-tops-shorter-1463669734">For Worldâ€™s Newest Scrabble Stars, SHORT Tops SHORTER</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"We tend to interpret new information in a way that fits with what
we already believe. It's what computer scientist Alan Kay calls
relativizing." (page 84)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This seems sort of interesting, but I don't see a good reference for
it.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Douglas Carl Engelbart, inventor of the computer mouse, has written
about the need to not only make the process of completing a set of
tasks more efficient, but also the process of questioning whether
the tasks are essential to begin with." (page 84)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would love to find this writing!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"We can't really explain a heap by analogy." (page 120)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>"When Feynman was once asked how he developed his legendary ability
to solve problems so quickly, he said that it was because he modeled
those problems in a multitude of ways, which is to say he looked at
them from different perspectives." (page 125)</p>
