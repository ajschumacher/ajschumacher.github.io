# Smarter, Faster, Better, by Duhigg

This is a very readable book that talks about motivation, teams
(psychological safety), appropriate focus, goal-setting (big and
SMART), management, decision-making, innovation, and absorbing data,
all through interesting stories. There's some good stuff.

Duhigg connects his book about productivity to the idea of
[his first book][] on habits.

[his first book]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Power_of_Habit "The Power of Habit"

> "Productive people have habits—what psychologists might call
> 'contemplative routines'—that push them to _think more deeply_ about
> the choices they make." (page 6)

The book spends substantial time exploring possible biological
[determinants][] of motivation, and then becomes less fatalistic.

[determinants]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Striatum "Striatum"

> "Motivation is more like a skill, akin to reading or writing, that
> can be learned and honed. Scientists have found that people can get
> better at self-motivation if they practice the right way. The trick,
> researchers say, is realizing that a prerequisite to motivation is
> believing we have authority over our actions and surroundings. To
> motivate ourselves, we must feel like we are in control." (page 19)

> "In the age of automation, knowing how to manage your focus is more

I think this is not correct; see
