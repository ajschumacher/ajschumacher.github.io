<h1>The Psychology of Money, by Housel</h1>
<p class="date">Sunday December 28, 2025</p>
<p>Housel had a <a href="https://collabfund.com/blog/the-psychology-of-money/">blog post</a> in 2018, and it was big enough that it
became a <a href="https://planetone.online/downloads/others/books/The_Psychology_of_Money.pdf">book</a> in 2020. It's wild how many books come about that
way now; it's like your proposal has to go viral before you get a book
deal.</p>
<p>The blog post and book are structured similarly <em>enough</em> that I think
it's interesting to compare them.</p>
<p>The blog post was a list of 20 items. I think 7 of them don't really
appear in the book at all, perhaps because they're too wonky or
specific:</p>
<ul>
<li>(9) Attachment to social proof in a field that demands contrarian
   thinking to achieve above-average results.</li>
<li>(10) An appeal to academia in a field that is governed not by clean
   rules but loose and unpredictable trends.</li>
<li>(12) A tendency toward action in a field where the first rule of
   compounding is to never interrupt it unnecessarily.</li>
<li>(15) An attachment to financial entertainment due to the fact that
   money is emotional, and emotions are revved up by argument, extreme
   views, flashing lights, and threats to your wellbeing.</li>
<li>(17) A preference for skills in a field where skills don’t matter
   if they aren’t matched with the right behavior.</li>
<li>(19) Political beliefs driving financial decisions, influenced by
   economics being a misbehaved cousin of politics.</li>
<li>(20) The three-month bubble: Extrapolating the recent past into the
   near future, and then overestimating the extent to which whatever
   you anticipate will happen in the near future will impact your
   future.</li>
</ul>
<p>The book, then, has 18 items: 13 from the blog post's list, and 5 that
are new (at least new as whole sections). The book has an intro, and
two other chapters in which are a summary and a breakdown of the
author's personal money choices, and then there's a postscript with
his "brief history of why the U.S. consumer thinks the way they do,"
which is something like "after WWII people got used to a little bit of
equality and a little bit of debt, and now they're using too much debt
to try to get back a little bit of equality".</p>
<p>Here are the book's chapters, with blog equivalents (original blog
post numbering in parens) and notes:</p>
<ol>
<li>No One's Crazy: Your personal experiences with money make up maybe
   0.00000001% of what's happened in the world, but maybe 80% of how
   you think the world works.<ul>
<li>(5) Anchored-to-your-own-history bias: Your personal experiences
  make up maybe 0.00000001% of what’s happened in the world but
  maybe 80% of how you think the world works.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Luck &amp; Risk: Nothing is as good or as bad as it seems.<ul>
<li>(1) Earned success and deserved failure fallacy: A tendency to
  underestimate the role of luck and risk, and a failure to
  recognize that luck and risk are different sides of the same
  coin.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Never Enough: When rich people do crazy things.<ul>
<li>This is the first new section, and it's about greed, in fairly
  extreme cases where successful people were found to have
  committed fraud even when you wouldn't think they'd need to. I
  think the section has noble intent but fails because (a) you
  have to believe that these people's <em>earlier</em> success was
  non-fraudulent, which is suspect (Madoff's earlier "success" was
  based on payment for order flow, it seems, which is illegal in
  Canada and disliked by many in the US) and (b) the general theme
  of avarice need not go so far as fraud to be worthwhile. See,
  for example, <a href="/20251123-your_money_or_your_life/">Your money or your life</a>. On the other hand,
  maybe it's easier to talk about greed with extreme cases so that
  the reader can safely revile them without finding them familiar.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Confounding Compounding: $81.5 billion of Warren Buffett's $84.5
   billion net worth came after his 65th birthday. Our minds are not
   built to handle such absurdities.<ul>
<li>(8) Underappreciating the power of compounding, driven by the
  tendency to intuitively think about exponential growth in linear
  terms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Getting Wealthy vs. Staying Wealthy: Good investing is not
   necessarily about making good decisions. It's about consistently
   not screwing up.<ul>
<li>(16) Optimism bias in risk-taking, or “Russian Roulette should
  statistically work” syndrome: An over attachment to favorable
  odds when the downside is unacceptable in any circumstance.</li>
<li>This one is tangled up with 13, and indeed includes "the most
  important part of every plan is to plan on the plan not going
  according to plan" here too. The distinction, perhaps, is about
  not actively <em>doing</em> things that risk ruining you, as opposed to
  defensively <em>protecting yourself</em> from outside forces ruining
  you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tails, You Win: You can be wrong half the time and still make a
   fortune.<ul>
<li>This is a new one, about making lots of bets. Assuming no bet
  can kill you, you only need a minority of them to do really well
  in order to win.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Freedom: Controlling your time is the highest dividend money pays.<ul>
<li>This appeared in the blog post in passing ("A key use of wealth
  is using it to control your time") but it's grown into a whole
  section and maybe even a theme in the book.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Man in the Car Paradox: No one is impressed with your possessions
   as much as you are.<ul>
<li>(3) Rich man in the car paradox</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Wealth is What You Don't See: Spending money to show people how
   much money you have is the fastest way to have less money.<ul>
<li>(11) The social utility of money coming at the direct expense of
  growing money; wealth is what you don’t see.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Save Money: The only factor you can control generates one of the
    only things that matters. How wonderful.<ul>
<li>Also new, and quite explicitly advice.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reasonable &gt; Rational: Aiming to be mostly reasonable works better
    than trying to be coldly rational.<ul>
<li>There's some of the "avoid Russian roulette" idea here, but this
  is mostly new... It's a little bit like how the "snowball
  method" of paying off small debts first is often a bad idea
  financially - unless doing it that way makes the difference
  between paying off debt and not doing so. Also sort of related
  to the idea of knowing the price of things: there can be a
  psychological price, which can be meaningful for an individual.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Surprise! History is the study of change, ironically used as a map
    of the future.<ul>
<li>(6) Historians are Prophets fallacy: Not seeing the irony that
  history is the study of surprises and changes while using it as
  a guide to the future. An overreliance on past data as a signal
  to future conditions in a field where innovation and change is
  the lifeblood of progress.</li>
<li>Vonnegut: “History is merely a list of surprises,' I said. 'It
  can only prepare us to be surprised yet again. Please write that
  down.” Housel has written it down.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Room for Error: The most important part of every plan is planning
    on your plan not going according to plan.<ul>
<li>(13) Underestimating the need for room for error, not just
  financially but mentally and physically.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You'll Change: Long-term planning is harder than it seems because
    people's goals and desires change over time.<ul>
<li>(4) A tendency to adjust to current circumstances in a way that
  makes forecasting your future desires and actions difficult,
  resulting in the inability to capture long-term compounding
  rewards that come from current decisions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Nothing's Free: Everything has a price, but not all prices appear
    on labels.<ul>
<li>(2) Cost avoidance syndrome: A failure to identify the true
  costs of a situation, with too much emphasis on financial costs
  while ignoring the emotional price that must be paid to win a
  reward.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You &amp; Me: Beware taking financial cues from people playing a
    different game than you are.<ul>
<li>(14) A tendency to be influenced by the actions of other people
  who are playing a different financial game than you are.</li>
<li>He's talking about bubbles. People driving up bubbles are not
  long-term investors, he says.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Seduction of Pessimism: Optimism sounds like a sales pitch.
    Pessimism sounds like someone trying to help you.<ul>
<li>(7) The seduction of pessimism in a world where optimism is the
  most reasonable stance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When You'll Believe Anything: Appealing fictions, and why stories
    are more powerful than statistics.<ul>
<li>(18) Denial of inconsistencies between how you think the world
  should work and how the world actually works, driven by a desire
  to form a clean narrative of cause and effect despite the
  inherent complexities of everything involving money.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All Together Now: What we've learned about the psychology of your
    own money.<ul>
<li>This is just a summary, as the heading suggests.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Confessions: The psychology of my own money.<ul>
<li>And here the author describes his own money choices, which I
  find reasonable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It's not all great, but it's not bad. Mostly reasonable advice, I
think. I feel like I agree with this guy. The repeated focus on
<em>survival,</em> for example, fits well with my ongoing vendetta against
expected value as the be-all and end-all of decision-making.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most of the reason why, I believe, is that we think about and are
taught about money in ways that are too much like physics (with
rules and laws) and not enough like psychology (with emotions and
nuance).</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Someone else agreeing with you is like evidence of being right that
doesn’t have to prove itself with facts.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Money has competition, rules, upsets, wins, losses, heroes,
villains, teams, and fans that makes it tantalizingly close to a
sporting event.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Everyone just believes what they want to believe, even when the
evidence shows something else. Stories over statistics.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>The New York Times wrote in 1955 about the growing desire, but
continued inability, to retire: “To rephrase an old saying: everyone
talks about retirement, but apparently very few do anything about
it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Mr. Madoff’s firm can execute trades so quickly and cheaply that it
actually pays other brokerage firms a penny a share to execute their
customers’ orders, profiting from the spread between bid and ask
prices that most stocks trade for.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>The End of History Illusion is what psychologists call the tendency
for people to be keenly aware of how much they’ve changed in the
past, but to underestimate how much their personalities, desires,
and goals are likely to change in the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Jason Zweig, the Wall Street Journal investment columnist, worked
with psychologist Daniel Kahneman on writing Kahneman’s book
Thinking, Fast and Slow. Zweig once told a story about a personality
quirk of Kahneman’s that served him well: “Nothing amazed me more
about Danny than his ability to detonate what we had just done,”
Zweig wrote. He and Kahneman could work endlessly on a chapter, but:</p>
<p>The next thing you know, [Kahneman] sends a version so utterly
transformed that it is unrecognizable: It begins differently, it
ends differently, it incorporates anecdotes and evidence you never
would have thought of, it draws on research that you’ve never heard
of.</p>
<p>“When I asked Danny how he could start again as if we had never
written an earlier draft,” Zweig continued, “he said the words I’ve
never forgotten: ‘I have no sunk costs.’”</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Bubbles form when the momentum of short-term returns attracts enough
money that the makeup of investors shifts from mostly long term to
mostly short term.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>And since big events come out of nowhere, forecasts may do more harm
than good, giving the illusion of predictability in a world where
unforeseen events control most outcomes.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>We’re so far committed to the independence camp that we’ve done
things that make little sense on paper. We own our house without a
mortgage, which is the worst financial decision we’ve ever made but
the best money decision we’ve ever made. Mortgage interest rates
were absurdly low when we bought our house. Any rational advisor
would recommend taking advantage of cheap money and investing extra
savings in higher-return assets, like stocks. But our goal isn’t to
be coldly rational; just psychologically reasonable.</p>
<p>The independent feeling I get from owning our house outright far
exceeds the known financial gain I’d get from leveraging our assets
with a cheap mortgage. Eliminating the monthly payment feels better
than maximizing the long-term value of our assets. It makes me feel
independent. I don’t try to defend this decision to those pointing
out its flaws, or those who would never do the same. On paper it’s
defenseless. But it works for us. We like it. That’s what matters.
Good decisions aren’t always rational. At some point you have to
choose between being happy or being “right.”</p>

<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>One of my deeply held investing beliefs is that there is little
correlation between investment effort and investment results.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Benedict Evans says, “The more the Internet exposes people to new
points of view, the angrier people get that different views exist.”</p>
