# The Psychology of Money, by Housel

Housel had a [blog post][] in 2018, and it was big enough that it
became a [book][] in 2020. It's wild how many books come about that
way now; it's like your proposal has to go viral before you get a book
deal.

[blog post]: https://collabfund.com/blog/the-psychology-of-money/
[book]: https://planetone.online/downloads/others/books/The_Psychology_of_Money.pdf


The blog post and book are structured similarly _enough_ that I think
it's interesting to compare them.

The blog post was a list of 20 items. I think 7 of them don't really
appear in the book at all, perhaps because they're too wonky or
specific:

 * (9) Attachment to social proof in a field that demands contrarian
   thinking to achieve above-average results.
 * (10) An appeal to academia in a field that is governed not by clean
   rules but loose and unpredictable trends.
 * (12) A tendency toward action in a field where the first rule of
   compounding is to never interrupt it unnecessarily.
 * (15) An attachment to financial entertainment due to the fact that
   money is emotional, and emotions are revved up by argument, extreme
   views, flashing lights, and threats to your wellbeing.
 * (17) A preference for skills in a field where skills don’t matter
   if they aren’t matched with the right behavior.
 * (19) Political beliefs driving financial decisions, influenced by
   economics being a misbehaved cousin of politics.
 * (20) The three-month bubble: Extrapolating the recent past into the
   near future, and then overestimating the extent to which whatever
   you anticipate will happen in the near future will impact your
   future.

The book, then, has 18 items: 13 from the blog post's list, and 5 that
are new (at least new as whole sections). The book has an intro, and
two other chapters in which are a summary and a breakdown of the
author's personal money choices, and then there's a postscript with
his "brief history of why the U.S. consumer thinks the way they do,"
which is something like "after WWII people got used to a little bit of
equality and a little bit of debt, and now they're using too much debt
to try to get back a little bit of equality".

Here are the book's chapters, with blog equivalents (original blog
post numbering in parens) and notes:

1. No One's Crazy: Your personal experiences with money make up maybe
   0.00000001% of what's happened in the world, but maybe 80% of how
   you think the world works.
    * (5) Anchored-to-your-own-history bias: Your personal experiences
      make up maybe 0.00000001% of what’s happened in the world but
      maybe 80% of how you think the world works.
2. Luck & Risk: Nothing is as good or as bad as it seems.
    * (1) Earned success and deserved failure fallacy: A tendency to
      underestimate the role of luck and risk, and a failure to
      recognize that luck and risk are different sides of the same
      coin.
3. Never Enough: When rich people do crazy things.
    * This is the first new section, and it's about greed, in fairly
      extreme cases where successful people were found to have
      committed fraud even when you wouldn't think they'd need to. I
      think the section has noble intent but fails because (a) you
      have to believe that these people's _earlier_ success was
      non-fraudulent, which is suspect (Madoff's earlier "success" was
      based on payment for order flow, it seems, which is illegal in
      Canada and disliked by many in the US) and (b) the general theme
      of avarice need not go so far as fraud to be worthwhile. See,
      for example, [Your money or your life][]. On the other hand,
      maybe it's easier to talk about greed with extreme cases so that
      the reader can safely revile them without finding them familiar.
4. Confounding Compounding: $81.5 billion of Warren Buffett's $84.5
   billion net worth came after his 65th birthday. Our minds are not
   built to handle such absurdities.
    * (8) Underappreciating the power of compounding, driven by the
      tendency to intuitively think about exponential growth in linear
      terms.
5. Getting Wealthy vs. Staying Wealthy: Good investing is not
   necessarily about making good decisions. It's about consistently
   not screwing up.
    * (16) Optimism bias in risk-taking, or “Russian Roulette should
      statistically work” syndrome: An over attachment to favorable
      odds when the downside is unacceptable in any circumstance.
    * This one is tangled up with 13, and indeed includes "the most
      important part of every plan is to plan on the plan not going
      according to plan" here too. The distinction, perhaps, is about
      not actively _doing_ things that risk ruining you, as opposed to
      defensively _protecting yourself_ from outside forces ruining
      you.
6. Tails, You Win: You can be wrong half the time and still make a
   fortune.
    * This is a new one, about making lots of bets. Assuming no bet
      can kill you, you only need a minority of them to do really well
      in order to win.
7. Freedom: Controlling your time is the highest dividend money pays.
    * This appeared in the blog post in passing ("A key use of wealth
      is using it to control your time") but it's grown into a whole
      section and maybe even a theme in the book.
8. Man in the Car Paradox: No one is impressed with your possessions
   as much as you are.
    * (3) Rich man in the car paradox
9. Wealth is What You Don't See: Spending money to show people how
   much money you have is the fastest way to have less money.
    * (11) The social utility of money coming at the direct expense of
      growing money; wealth is what you don’t see.
10. Save Money: The only factor you can control generates one of the
    only things that matters. How wonderful.
    * Also new, and quite explicitly advice.
11. Reasonable > Rational: Aiming to be mostly reasonable works better
    than trying to be coldly rational.
    * There's some of the "avoid Russian roulette" idea here, but this
      is mostly new... It's a little bit like how the "snowball
      method" of paying off small debts first is often a bad idea
      financially - unless doing it that way makes the difference
      between paying off debt and not doing so. Also sort of related
      to the idea of knowing the price of things: there can be a
      psychological price, which can be meaningful for an individual.
12. Surprise! History is the study of change, ironically used as a map
    of the future.
    * (6) Historians are Prophets fallacy: Not seeing the irony that
      history is the study of surprises and changes while using it as
      a guide to the future. An overreliance on past data as a signal
      to future conditions in a field where innovation and change is
      the lifeblood of progress.
    * Vonnegut: “History is merely a list of surprises,' I said. 'It
      can only prepare us to be surprised yet again. Please write that
      down.” Housel has written it down.
13. Room for Error: The most important part of every plan is planning
    on your plan not going according to plan.
    * (13) Underestimating the need for room for error, not just
      financially but mentally and physically.
14. You'll Change: Long-term planning is harder than it seems because
    people's goals and desires change over time.
    * (4) A tendency to adjust to current circumstances in a way that
      makes forecasting your future desires and actions difficult,
      resulting in the inability to capture long-term compounding
      rewards that come from current decisions.
15. Nothing's Free: Everything has a price, but not all prices appear
    on labels.
    * (2) Cost avoidance syndrome: A failure to identify the true
      costs of a situation, with too much emphasis on financial costs
      while ignoring the emotional price that must be paid to win a
      reward.
16. You & Me: Beware taking financial cues from people playing a
    different game than you are.
    * (14) A tendency to be influenced by the actions of other people
      who are playing a different financial game than you are.
    * He's talking about bubbles. People driving up bubbles are not
      long-term investors, he says.
17. The Seduction of Pessimism: Optimism sounds like a sales pitch.
    Pessimism sounds like someone trying to help you.
    * (7) The seduction of pessimism in a world where optimism is the
      most reasonable stance.
18. When You'll Believe Anything: Appealing fictions, and why stories
    are more powerful than statistics.
    * (18) Denial of inconsistencies between how you think the world
      should work and how the world actually works, driven by a desire
      to form a clean narrative of cause and effect despite the
      inherent complexities of everything involving money.
19. All Together Now: What we've learned about the psychology of your
    own money.
    * This is just a summary, as the heading suggests.
20. Confessions: The psychology of my own money.
    * And here the author describes his own money choices, which I
      find reasonable.

It's not all great, but it's not bad. Mostly reasonable advice, I
think. I feel like I agree with this guy. The repeated focus on
_survival,_ for example, fits well with my ongoing vendetta against
expected value as the be-all and end-all of decision-making.
