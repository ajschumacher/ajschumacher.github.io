# The End of Everything, by Mack

Here's a fun [book][] by a millennial astrophysicist. I hadn't thought
about a big bang with an infinite universe before; that's fun. I would
have enjoyed more on how we know we're in a false vacuum and how fast
everything has moved over time, but it's a light pop book.

Ways for the universe to end:

 * Big Crunch (gravity crushes us)
 * Heat Death (best guess; things get cold and lonely)
 * Big Rip (things eventually spread out explosively, on local scales)
 * Vacuum Decay (suddenly ice-9 but for everything)
 * Bounce (maybe we hit another 3-brane or something?)

If this is the standard, you will only accept mathematical truths. The
book seems to care quite a bit about observation and measurement, so I
assume she's being rather loose with language here.

As explained in the book, it seems like this could be read "the faster
it _was_ receding from us" because light from far away is quite old. I
didn't catch it if there was an explanation of how we work out how
fast we think those distant things are moving away now.

This is particularly perplexing because the book explains that it
looks like (by redshift) very distant things are receding fastest,
less distant things look to be receding less fast, and the nearest
things look to be coming toward us. So my naive thought is: How do we
know that the distant things aren't currently coming toward us now?

There is presumably some clever way to work this out?

That introduces the [distance ladder][], but I think still doesn't
address the above.

It isn't quite "just like" that, I think... I mean, the trampoline
analogy isn't good either...

This, I think, is very true. What does distance even mean?

The play [Arcadia][], quoted in the epigraph of Chapter 4, seems neat.

How does the data suggest that we're in a local minimum vacuum? How
can we tell that?

The epigraph for Chapter 8 quotes Hozier's "[No Plan][]" but I prefer
their "[Nobody][]." The drums are bananas.
