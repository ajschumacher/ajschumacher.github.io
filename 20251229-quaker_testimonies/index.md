# Quaker Testimonies

 * Simplicity
 * Peace
 * Integrity (Truth)
 * Community
 * Equality
 * Stewardship


Quakers are interesting. The list here is the SPICES list of
Testimonies, or values, which appears for example on the
[DC Quakers site][]. A list of four items (Simplicity, Truth,
Equality, Peace) is also common, for example appearing on the
[UK Quakers site][].

As the two versions suggest, Quakers don't have to agree on much.
Different "Yearly Meetings" put together their own books. Here's a
selection from the [Faith and Practice][] of the Baltimore Yearly
Meeting:

[Faith and Practice]: https://www.bym-rsf.org/file_download/inline/281d7f8f-f578-4b0a-baeb-8ab753a30320

> Baltimore Yearly Meeting has no binding creed. Its principles of
> belief are based on its Judeo-Christian heritage and adherence to
> the Spirit of Christ (the Inward Light, the Divine Seed, That of God
> in Everyone). The testimonies spring from respect for truth; for
> peace, harmony, and a settled intention to practice love; for
> simplicity, community, and the equal worth of all people.


No fixed list of Testimonies, then, is official. Some Quaker Friends
even [object][] to them:

[object]: https://www.friendsjournal.org/categorically-not-the-testimonies/

> Human beings need words to communicate. But when we codify, make
> creeds, and canonize a few words, we limit our vision, as well as
> the possibility of God’s work through us. Walking away from such
> deified virtues, where might we go instead? What if we were to start
> with fresh, personal experiences and then shared them in a manner
> that was as mediated as little as possible by advance expectations?


It's an interesting and characteristically Quaker objection.
