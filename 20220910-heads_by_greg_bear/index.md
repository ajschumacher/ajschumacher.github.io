# Heads, by Greg Bear

I read this because I heard it was about consciousness. It was only a
little bit about consciousness. Some quantum computers had some kind
of consciousness, but they were not central to anything. At the end
there was some possible additional consciousness stuff, but mostly
not. In the end, not nearly enough about consciousness. Three stars.
