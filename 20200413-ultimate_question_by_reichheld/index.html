<h1>The Ultimate Question 2.0, by Reichheld</h1>
<p class="date">Monday April 13, 2020</p>
<p>I was interested in Net PromoterÂ® score, so I read <a href="https://www.netpromotersystem.com/books/the-ultimate-question-2.0/" title="The Ultimate Question 2.0">the book</a>, which
is a longer version of <a href="https://hbr.org/2003/12/the-one-number-you-need-to-grow" title="The One Number You Need to Grow">the original article</a>. NPS is an interesting
case study in simplicity, interpretability, paths to action,
unintended consequences, and data collection.</p>
<h3>Simplicity</h3>
<p>Net Promoter is built around one question, now common in many
variants, about whether you'd make a recommendation.</p>
<p><img alt="NPS summary" src="nps_summary.png" /></p>
<p>The single-question approach may help with response rate, but that
isn't the only rationale.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Traditional satisfaction surveys ... ask too many questions and
inspire analysis instead of action." (pages ix-x)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reichheld describes research supporting the use of a single question
as a correlate of growth, and clustering analysis supporting the three
response categories. Whether these are perfect is beside the point of
<em>focusing</em> on <em>some</em> data about customer experience.</p>
<h3>Interpretability</h3>
<p>The Net Promoter score is explained as the percentage of promoters
minus the percentage of detractors. This is equivalent to averaging a
remapping of the 0 to 10 scale, but better at maintaining a meaningful
interpretation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"[This] made sense to frontline managers, who could relate to the
goal of increasing the number of promoters and reducing the number
of detractors more readily than increasing the mean of their
satisfaction index by one standard deviation." (<a href="https://hbr.org/2003/12/the-one-number-you-need-to-grow" title="The One Number You Need to Grow">HBR</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This scoring method amounts to a kind of data visualization, focused
on communicating and understanding. Whether or not it generates the
best correlation coefficients with other quantities of interest,
there's little doubt that it's instantly understandable.</p>
<h3>Paths to Action</h3>
<p>The Net Promoter <em>score</em> is quantitative, but the <em>system</em> is always
supposed to include a second question: "What is the primary reason for
your score?" This is one of the ways that NPS becomes actionable.</p>
<p>The open-ended follow-up avoids "the preconceived response categories
of traditional customer-satisfaction questionnaires" (page 5) and
invites the power of anecdote.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Reading a comment from a customer promoter or detractor has far
more impact than looking at a statistic on a monthly report from
headquarters." (page 186)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The bottom-up application of NPS is intended to be non-anonymous and
closed-loop: An employee might call detractors shortly after their
responses come in to apologize and try to address issues immediately.</p>
<p>This kind of feedback helps to "Make NPS a tool to help people succeed
(not just an evaluation metric)" (page 254) independent of statistics.
The scores themselves can also be used more directly, but not without
risk.</p>
<h3>Unintended Consequences</h3>
<p>NPS generates scores can be compared, incentivized, and then gamed:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law">Goodhart's law</a>.</p>
<p>NPS can also be used to evaluate employee satisfaction: "employee Net
Promoter scores (eNPS)" (page 165). Like any data, it can be used for
questionable purposes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When JetBlue first began its eNPS surveys, it discovered pockets of
detractors. Upon deeper investigation, management learned that some
of these unhappy employees were preparing a union-organizing
campaign. Rapid intervention helped resolve the key issues before
things reached that point." (page 168)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Data Collection</h3>
<p>It's hard to get people to fill out surveys in the age of survey
fatigue.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Customers already receive too many survey requests, and as NPS
spreads, their tolerance will diminish." (page 238 of 2011 version
of 2006 book)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reichheld recommends using phone surveys over register receipt surveys
or email surveys.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Phone surveys may not be the right long-term solution for your
firm, but beware of defaulting to the cheapest alternative." (page
237)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even with the shortest possible surveys, people are just
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-04/tasty-taco-helpful-hygienist-are-all-those-surveys-of-any-use" title="The Inventor of Customer Satisfaction Surveys Is Sick of Them, Too">sick of them</a>, which is a challenge for getting good data.</p>
<hr />
<p>Reichheld is a consultant who focuses on customer loyalty. Cynically,
he wants to be known for "a full-fledged management system with an
ethos that rivals <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Sigma">Six Sigma</a> in power" (front flap) and get his
metric on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balanced_scorecard">balanced scorecards</a>. Less cynically, he really wants
companies to treat everyone well and avoid "bad profits" created by
taking advantage of customers.</p>

<p>"A bounced check cost [Charles Schwab Corporation] 82 cents, but the
firm charged the client $40." (page 128)</p>
